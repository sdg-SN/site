(See methodology section for details of questions asked).</p>\n<p><strong>Greening</strong></p>\n<p>To measure the extent to which green content is integrated in the official intended curriculum of primary and (lower) secondary education, two types of documents were analysed to create a country&#x2019;s Greening Curriculum Indicator (GCI) score: 1) <strong>national curriculum frameworks</strong> and 2) <strong>subject curricula documents</strong> from science and social science subjects taught in grades 3, 6, and 9. The terms curriculum or syllabus here should be distinguished from related terms such as textbook, lesson plan, and teaching guidelines. A database of over 1,700 curriculum documents has been compiled for the 2025 data release.</p>\n<h3><em>National curriculum frameworks (NCFs)</em></h3>\n<p>NCFs<strong> </strong>are defined as national-level policy documents that overview a country&#x2019;s educational goals and priorities and set forth key parameters of the country&#x2019;s official intended curriculum. NCFs are written and approved by the relevant ministry of education or another officially designated body. A comprehensive NCF: 1) delineates the aims of the curriculum at various stages of schooling; 2) explains the educational philosophy underlying the curriculum and approaches to teaching, learning, and assessment that align with that philosophy; 3) describes curricular structures; 4) assigns names to subject/learning areas; 5) allocates time to each subject (or group of subjects) in each grade level (or set of grades); 6) provides guidelines to curriculum developers, teacher trainers, and textbook writers; 7) prescribes curricular standards and mechanisms for inspection and monitoring; and 8) refers to learning assessments to be conducted (UNESCO-IBE, 2017a; UNESCO-IBE, 2017b). </p>\n<p>To be considered an NCF for the purposes of the GCI, the document has to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Be written by the ministry of education or other official designated body.</li>\n  <li>Cover primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary levels of formal education (categories 1, 2, and 3 according to the International Standard Classification of Education or ISCED).<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></sup></li>\n  <li>Have a title or opening matter that describes the document as a National Curriculum Framework.</li>\n  <li>Include content that aligns with the sections outlined in the document definitions above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In cases where an NCF matching the above criteria was not identified, other documents containing similar content to an NCF were considered for inclusion. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The introductory or front matter of document(s) specifying the content of subject curricula similarly to an NCF.</li>\n  <li>Laws or regulations passed by legislative or executive bodies that specify curricular structures and contents of a national education system along the lines of an NCF.</li>\n  <li>Official websites of national governments or subnational political units that present in a similar manner to an NCF.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><em>Subject curricula</em></h3>\n<p>Subject curricula or subject syllabi are defined as subject- and grade-specific documents that include most or all of the following information: 1) a general rationale for the teaching of the subject; 2) the intended aims and learning outcomes; 3) clearly defined content areas (topics and themes) to be included in the teaching of each subject; and 4) ideally, a weekly, monthly, or yearly timetable allocating instructional time to each topic/subject, pedagogical considerations, and possibly assessment guidelines. The name given to such documents varies by language &#x2013; for example, &#x201C;programme&#x201D; (French), &#x201C;Lehrplan&#x201D; (German), &#x201C;programma&#x201D; (Italian), &#x201C;plan de estudios&#x201D; (Spanish) and &#x201C;almanhaj&#x201D; (Arabic) &#x2013; and may have slightly different connotations. There are no international guidelines for subject curricula, partly because they reflect national traditions in the development and implementation of the official curriculum, the extent of teacher and school autonomy, and patterns of pre-service and in-service teacher training.</p>\n<p>Subject curricula were included for subjects in two broad knowledge domains: science and social science. Curricula for up to four subjects in each knowledge domain (thus up to eight subjects in total) were included at each grade level (3, 6, and 9) in each country or sub-national jurisdiction. Table 1 lists the typical subjects found in each knowledge domain internationally. Many countries organize instruction in a single general science and/or social science subject (more common in grades 3 and 6), rather than numerous specialized subjects (more common in grade 9). Some countries teach interdisciplinary subjects such as environmental education (EE) or education for sustainable development (ESD) or special hybrid subjects that combine science and social science content. Such interdisciplinary or hybrid subjects were included among the up to eight subjects per grade level. </p>\n<p>Table 1: List of typical science, social science and EE/ESD subjects included in GCI calculations</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Science Subjects</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Social Science Subjects</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong> EE/ESD subjects</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <ul>\n          <li>General Science</li>\n          <li>Applied Science / Technology</li>\n          <li>Earth Science</li>\n          <li>Life Science</li>\n          <li>Physical Science</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <ul>\n          <li>General Social Science</li>\n          <li>Geography</li>\n          <li>History</li>\n          <li>Civics/Citizenship</li>\n          <li>Economics</li>\n          <li>Religious, Moral, and Philosophy</li>\n          <li>Cultural and Art Studies</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Environmental Education</li>\n          <li>Environmental Education / Education for Sustainable Development</li>\n          <li>Environmental and Outdoor Education </li>\n          <li>Sustainability</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Note</em>.

Documents are downloaded if found online and converted to PDF if in another format. In many cases, subject curricula are part of a larger document, in which case, relevant subject- and grade-specific material are extracted into separate documents. Documents in the database are named using the following protocol:</p>\n<p><em> &#x201C;country_state/province_documenttype_region_year_language_grade_knowledgedomain&#x201D;</em></p>\n<p>Information about each document is stored in a database (one row per document), including document title, year of publication, subject, author, source, and language. </p>\n<p>For documents in languages for which there are fewer than three documents in that language (Burmese, Norwegian, Swedish, and Urdu), the documents are machine translated into English using Google Translate.</p>\n<h2><em>Keyword selection and analysis</em></h2>\n<p>The GCI measures the inclusion of green content in four document types (NCF, grade 3 subject curricula, grade 6 subject curricula, and grade 9 subject curricula). It counts the presence of 13 keywords corresponding to three themes of Environment/Sustainability, Climate Change, and Biodiversity. The selected keywords: 1) best represent the theme, 2) can be translated into all relevant languages, and 3) are sufficiently prevalent in the analysed documents to provide data for measuring components of the GCI (see Table 2 above). Additional sources such as recent UNESCO studies of greening education and the Greening Education Partnership curriculum guidance were also used to identify relevant green keywords.</p>\n<p>Each keyword includes its plural and singular as well as the many forms the word may take depending on the language.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></sup> Some languages and/or countries employ distinctive language/culture-specific keywords to capture a theme. Thus, each theme includes space for a culture- or language-specific keyword to be added, if appropriate.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></sup> The keywords and their translations into 40 languages are reviewed and validated by native speaking experts who are familiar with greening education concepts.</p>\n<p>A Python-based application is used to bulk process text files and identify keywords in documents in all the required languages. To be read by the Python application, all the text documents are converted to UTF-8 text format and stored in a local folder. The Python application also requires a two-column spreadsheet with columns for &quot;File Name&quot; and &quot;Language&quot; and a second spreadsheet with columns for &#x201C;Keyword&#x201D; and the keyword&#x2019;s &#x201C;Language.&#x201D; These files and the folder location are then loaded into the Python application. The application uses the language file to determine which column from the keyword file to utilize in searching for keywords for each text file. The application then counts relevant keywords in every document (NCF and subject curricula) in the specified language. After completing the keyword search processing, the application outputs a spreadsheet file that contains a row for each curriculum document and columns for every keyword.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup></sup> This output file becomes the raw data used in the calculation of the GCI. </p>\n<h2><em>Calculation of the greening curriculum indicator</em></h2>\n<p>After the prevalence of each keyword in each document is determined, keyword counts are compiled into an output spreadsheet which is then used to calculate a country&#x2019;s GCI score. The following specific steps are taken to calculate a country&#x2019;s GCI score:</p>\n<h3><em>Phase 1) Development of standardized keyword counts</em></h3>\n<p>The analysis of the green content of each country&#x2019;s NCFs and subject curricula is done at the country level.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>For the NCF and each grade level (3, 6, and 9), the frequency of keywords belonging to the themes of Environment/Sustainability, Climate Change, and Biodiversity is calculated by summing up the counts of the keywords.</li>\n  <li>To account for varying document lengths, the number of keywords is standardized for each theme by dividing the keywords counts in that country&#x2019;s theme with the total number of words in the country&#x2019;s documents. </li>\n  <li>This standardized number is then multiplied by 1 million to transform the result into a number that is more easily interpreted (i.e., not a very small decimal). The result is a keyword count per million words for each theme at each grade level and NCF for each country. The standardization calculation is as follows:<ul>\n      <li>1,000,000*(Keywords in that theme for a country) / (Total words in documents for that country) </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><em>Phase 2) Transformation of standardized keyword counts into an ordinal scale</em></h3>\n<p>The distribution of these standardized numbers presents a statistical challenge since it is both zero bounded<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-ref-10\">[9]</a></sup></sup> and has a long tail.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\" id=\"footnote-ref-11\">[10]</a></sup></sup> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>To create a more normal distribution, the standardized numbers are transformed into an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 10 in the following way: <ul>\n      <li>If there are no keywords, the score is 0, otherwise it ranges from 1 to 10 using a &#xBD; life logarithmic transformation.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-12\" id=\"footnote-ref-12\">[11]</a></sup></sup> </li>\n      <li>For the Environment/Sustainability &apos;core&apos; theme, the maximum score of 10 is achieved with 10,000 standardized keywords. The following formulas are used:<ul>\n          <li>&gt;10,000 standardized keywords are assigned a score of 10,</li>\n          <li>&lt;=20 standardized keywords are assigned a score of 1,</li>\n          <li>0 standardized keywords are assigned a score of 0,</li>\n          <li>Otherwise, 10-log.5(#/10,000)</li>\n          <li>Result multiplied by 10</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>For the Climate Change and Biodiversity themes, the maximum score of 10 is achieved with 5,000 standardized keywords, given that these keywords are used less commonly. The following formulas are used:<ul>\n          <li>&gt;5,000 standardized keywords are assigned a score of 10, </li>\n          <li>&lt;=10 standardized keywords are assigned a score of 1, </li>\n          <li>0 standardized keywords are assigned a score of 0, </li>\n          <li>Otherwise, 10-log.5(#/5,000)</li>\n          <li>Result multiplied by 10</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3><em>Phase 3) Calculating GCIs for federated countries</em></h3>\n<p>To calculate the GCI for federated countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Switzerland, United Kingdom), all of the above mentioned steps are carried out for <u>each</u> sub-national jurisdiction, which results in a number of (sub-national) GCIs. The sub-national GCI scores for the country are then averaged into a national GCI score. The data for all federated countries are then added to the dataset produced in Phase 1.</p>\n<h3><em>Phase 4) Final calculation of the GCI</em></h3>\n<p>At this point, each country has either three or four document-specific scores (ranging from 0 to 10) for each of the three themes (i.e., 9 or 12 total scores, since countries are included if they have at least 3 of the 4 main document types (NCF, grade 3 subject curricula, grade 6 subject curricula, and grade 9 subject curricula).</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Within each of the Environment/Sustainability, Climate Change, and Biodiversity themes, the three grade level scores and the NCF score are averaged together (i.e., each contributes &#xBC; of the total score per theme in a country). For countries with only three document types, the same procedure is done but each document score contributes &#x2153; of the total theme-focused score.</li>\n  <li>A single overall GCI score is now calculated based on a weighted mean, with the Environment/Sustainability core theme weighted 50% and the Climate Change and Biodiversity themes each weighted at 25%.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities), and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers), as appropriate. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities), and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers), as appropriate. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-5\">4</sup><p> GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities) and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers), as appropriate. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-5\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> GCED and ESD are mainstreamed if they or their themes and sub-themes are mentioned explicitly in relevant documents and are expected to be implemented by the relevant authorities (e.g. Ministries, regional or local education authorities), educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges and universities) and/or education professionals (e.g. teachers and lecturers) as appropriate. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">6</sup><p> Different forms of the word are included only due to genders, definite articles, etc. but not when they change the meaning or part of speech. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> For example, in China the phrase &#x2018;ecological civilization&#x2019; is now being used much more frequently than &#x2018;sustainable development&#x2019; or &#x2018;environmental.&#x2019; In Japan, the term &#x2018;sustainable societies&#x2019; is becoming more prevalent than the term &#x2018;sustainable development.&#x2019; At this point in time, no culture- or language-specific keywords are included in the GCI. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-9\">8</sup><p> To determine the accuracy of the counts generated by the Python program, a validation exercise was carried out in October 2024 by sampling 30 documents in English, Spanish, Arabic and French, the four most prevalent languages.

So, for example, if 10,000 standardized references is a score of 10, 5,000 is a score of 9, 2,500 is a score of 8, and so on. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-12\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Survey</strong></p>\n<p>Responses are reviewed by UNESCO for consistency and credibility and, if necessary, queries are raised with national respondents.

As such, the focus of document compilation is all 193 UN Member States as well as 3 additional entities (i.e., Cook Islands, Niue, and Palestine), which are parties to the UNFCCC. Among these 196 possible countries, inclusion in the GCI is dependent on whether a sufficiently complete set of documents for that country has been compiled. A sufficient set of documents means having at least three of the following four types of documents that meet the previously outlined criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Grade 3 subject curricula</li>\n  <li>Grade 6 subject curricula</li>\n  <li>Grade 9 subject curricula</li>\n  <li>National Curriculum Framework (NCF)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A special notation (i.e., &quot;Qualifier of Data-Partial Data&quot;) is placed in the database to indicate cases where the GCI was calculated based on three of the four document types.
