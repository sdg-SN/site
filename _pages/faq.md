## How often will new data be added to this site?
We will add data as soon as it has been sourced and checked. This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible.


## What do each of the three tiers mean?
Each of the SDG indicators are assigned to one (or more) of the following tiers:
 - **Tier 1:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.

 - **Tier 2:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.

 - **Tier 3:** No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested (As of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission, the global indicator framework does not contain any Tier III indicators)

**As of 28 December 2020:** The updated tier classification contains **130 Tier I indicators**, **97 Tier II indicators** and **4 indicators that have multiple tiers** (different components of the indicator are classified into different tiers).
