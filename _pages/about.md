The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:
  * end poverty
  * protect the planet
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).

## About this site
The Senegal SDG-SDMX platform is a national tool for monitoring and disseminating data related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It was established by the National Agency of Statistics and Demography (ANSD), in collaboration with sectoral ministries and technical and financial partners (UNSD, AfDB, and ONS-UK).

Its main objective is to make statistical data on the SDGs accessible, reliable, and comparable in order to:
* Monitor Senegal’s progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda goals ;
* Strengthen transparency and accountability to citizens and partners ;
* Facilitate evidence-based decision-making ;
* Harmonize national statistics with international standards through the SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) framework.
* The platform enables users to:
* Explore Senegal’s SDG indicators ;
* Visualize interactive charts, maps, and tables ;
* Download data in different formats (Excel, CSV, SDMX);
* Access metadata to better understand indicator definitions and methodologies.
* By making data more accessible and interoperable, the platform contributes to strengthening the National Statistical System (NSS) and to enhancing Senegal’s integration into regional and international SDG monitoring initiatives.
