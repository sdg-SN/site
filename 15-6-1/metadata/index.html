The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p>\n<p>The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. </p>\n<p>The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.</p>\n<p>The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding to contribute to sustainable agriculture and food security, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. The Standard Material Transfer Agreement is a mandatory standard contract for parties wishing to provide and receive material under the Multilateral System. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>For data series ER CBD PTYPGRFA, ER CBD NAGOYA, ER CBD ORSPGRFA, CBD ABSCLRHS the unit of measurement is a binary measure (1 = YES; 0 = NO).</p>\n<p>For data series ER CBD SMTA the unit of measurement is number of Standard Material Transfer Agreements (SMTAs).

The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same manner.</p>\n<p>In order to promote compliance with all the provisions of the International Treaty, including access and benefit sharing obligations, and to address issues of non-compliance, the Governing Body of the International Treaty has approved the procedures and operational mechanisms by Resolution 2/2011. Under V. 1, it is noted that each Contracting Party is to submit to the Compliance Committee, established by the Governing Body by Resolution 3/2006, through the Secretary, a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty in one of the six languages of the United Nations. Contracting Parties have submitted their report by using a standard reporting format approved by the Governing Body, sending it to the Secretary.

In particular, countries will need, depending on their specific circumstances, to revise legislative, administrative or policy measures already in place or develop new measures in order to meet the obligations set out under the Protocol. </p>\n<p>In particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by indigenous communities, and benefits arising from the utilization of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. </p>\n<p>The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same manner. The goal is to allow users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge to easily find information on the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources and knowledge in an organized manner, and all in one convenient location.</p>\n<p>The International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and procedures with their obligations under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other facilitated access to a selection of their plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, while users are encouraged to share their benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow to farmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. </p>\n<p>Pursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and operational mechanism to promote compliance and address issues of non-compliance. Under the monitoring and reporting in the Procedures, each Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty, including the access and benefit-sharing measures. Contracting Parties report using an agreed standard format and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance. Additionally, information on the number of Standard Material Transfer Agreements is gathered from the Data Store of the International Treaty through Easy-SMTA. SMTA is a mandatory contract that Contracting Parties of the International Treaty have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources falling under the Multilateral System are made available. </p>\n<p>Indicator 15.6.1 directly measures progress made by countries in establishing legislative, administrative or policy frameworks on access and benefit-sharing (ABS). By developing their ABS frameworks, countries are contributing to the achievement of SDG Target 15.6 and to the conservation and sustainable use of biological and genetic diversity. Progress in this indicator is assessed through measuring the increase in the number of countries that have adopted ABS legislative, administrative and policy measures and that have made available this information in the ABS Clearing-House and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. </p>\n<p><u>The indicator consists of 4 sub-indicators: </u></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Countries that are Contracting Parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture;</li>\n  <li>Countries that are Parties to the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity;</li>\n  <li>Countries that have legislative, administrative and policy measures reported through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture;</li>\n  <li>Countries that have legislative, administrative or policy measures reported to the Access and Benefit-Sharing Clearing-House of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An additional sub-indicator provides complementary information on the number, by country, of Standard Material Transfer Agreements (SMTAs) transfering plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks over time.</p>\n<p>This indicator does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks. </p>\n<p>The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules established on access and benefit-sharing. However, it is difficult to have a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative, administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>For CBD ABSCLRHS, the indicator is calculated based on national information made available to the Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House. If a country has published at least one legislative, administrative or policy measure to ensure fair and equitable benefit-sharing, the data compilers will indicate 1 (1=YES). For ER_CBD_ORSPGRFA, the method of computation is the same but is calculated based on information from national reports submitted to the Secretariat of the International Treaty on PGRFA.</p>\n<p><br>For ER_CBD_NAGOYA and ER_CBD_PTYPGRFA, the indicator is calculated based on the status of ratifications to the Nagoya Protocol and the International Treaty on PGRFA, respectively. If a country has ratified/acceded/accepted the respective treaty, the data compilers will indicate 1 (1=YES). </p>\n<p>For ER_CBD_SMTA (complementary sub-indicator), the indicator is calculated based on information generated through the Easy-SMTA platform. The data is the number of SMTA reported through the online system of Easy-SMTA for each country. SMTA is a mandatory contract that Contracting Parties of the International Treaty have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources falling under the Multilateral System are made available through transfer.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The sub-indicator data may be validated independently by consulting the following websites:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>ER_CBD_PTYPGRFA: Website of the International Treaty on PGRFA (http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/countries/membership/en/)</li>\n  <li>ER_CBD_NAGOYA: United Nations Treaty Collection (<a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-8-b&amp;chapter=27\">https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-8-b&amp;chapter=27</a>) </li>\n  <li>CBD ABSCLRHS: Access and Benefit-Sharing Clearing-House Country Profiles (<a href=\"https://absch.cbd.int/countries\">https://absch.cbd.int/countries</a>) </li>\n  <li>ER_CBD_ORSPGRFA: National Reports of the International Treaty (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/areas-of-work/compliance/compliance-reports/en/\">http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/areas-of-work/compliance/compliance-reports/en/</a>) </li>\n  <li>ER_CBD_SMTA: Easy-SMTA (<a href=\"https://mls.planttreaty.org\">https://mls.planttreaty.org</a>) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As these sub-indicators are based on nationally reported information, there is no additional consultation or validation process in place with national focal points or authorities.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>For CBD ABSCLRHS and ER_CBD_NAGOYA, and ER_CBD_PTYPGRFA and ER_CBD_ORSPGRFA, there is a need for the data compilers to subtract the European Union from regional and global aggregations. The European Union is a Party to the Nagoya Protocol and the International Treaty, but is not counted as a country for these indicators.</p>\n<p>For ER_CBD_SMTA, the SMTA is a private contract, therefore it is reported by users, not by a government focal point.
