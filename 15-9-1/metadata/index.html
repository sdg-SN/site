In the same decision, the Conference of the Parties requested the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity to prepare an analysis/synthesis of national, regional and other actions, including targets as appropriate, established in accordance with the Strategic Plan, to enable the Conference of Parties at its sixteenth and subsequent meetings to assess the contribution of such national and regional targets towards the global targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: For sub-indicator (b), the UNCEEA was established by the UN Statistical Commission at its 36<sup>th</sup> session in March 2005. The UNCEEA functions as an intergovernmental body to provide overall vision, coordination, prioritization and direction in the field of environmental economic accounting and supporting statistics. As Secretariat to the UNCEEA, UNSD administers the Global Assessment on Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The objective of Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 14 is to ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into policies, regulations, planning and development processes, poverty eradication strategies, strategic environmental assessments, environmental impact assessments and, as appropriate, national accounting, within and across all levels of government and across all sectors, in particular those with significant impacts on biodiversity, progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of this framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>:<strong> </strong>National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans are described in Article 6 of the Convention on Biological Diversity on General Measures for Conservation and Sustainable Use. Under this article, it is stated that &#x201C;each Party to the Convention shall, in accordance with its particular conditions and capabilities: (a) Develop national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity or adapt for this purpose existing strategies, plans or programmes which shall reflect, <em>inter alia</em>, the measures set out in this Convention relevant to the Contracting Party concerned; and (b) Integrate, as far as possible and as appropriate, the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral or cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies&#x201D;. Further, under Article 26, it is stated that &#x201C;each Contracting Party shall, at intervals to be determined by the Conference of the Parties, present to the Conference of the Parties, reports on measures which it has taken for the implementation of the provisions of this Convention and their effectiveness in meeting the objectives of this Convention&#x201D;.</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>:<strong> </strong>Integration of biodiversity values into national accounting and reporting systems can be achieved through implementation of the international statistical standard, the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The SEEA Central Framework (SEEA CF) was adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 2012 as the first international standard for environmental-economic accounting. In addition, the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2021. Results of the Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics provide the data needed for Sub-indicator (b) of the indicator.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: The assessment of national targets has several limitations stemming from the different approaches Parties have taken in setting national targets and in reporting against them. Parties have mapped their national targets to the GBF Targets in different ways and based on different information. The different approaches in national target-setting and reporting present challenges to undertaking analysis in a systematic manner. </p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: The SEEA EA was adopted in March 2021, and the way that the SEEA EA is implemented by countries is expected to develop over time. In addition, the extent to which specific SEEA accounts relate to biodiversity differs, and some accounts relate more directly to biodiversity than others. Thus, the extent to which certain SEEA accounts directly integrate biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems will also differ.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: The seventh and eighth national reports provide progress made in achieving the national targets and/or the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, The progress assessment for Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 14 would thus provide critical information for indicator 15.9.1. </p>\n<p>Parties are also requested to use the monitoring framework of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, in their national reports, supplemented by optional component and complementary indicators and also other national indicators.</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-indicator (b)</strong>: The Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting Statistics collects information on whether countries are currently planning or implementing SEEA accounts, the specific accounts being implemented and plans for new/future accounts. Sub-indicator (b) is defined as the number of countries, which indicate they have implemented any SEEA Central Framework or SEEA Ecosystem Accounting accounts in their response to the Global Assessment. The sub-indicator uses the definition of implementation put forth by the UNCEEA, which disaggregates implementation into three progressive stages:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Compilation: A country falls into this stage if it has compiled at least one account (which is consistent with the SEEA) over the past five years.</li>\n  <li>Dissemination: A country falls into this stage if it has compiled and published at least one account within the past five years. </li>\n  <li>Regular compilation and dissemination: A country falls into this stage if it regularly publishes at least one account. Regularly published accounts are compiled and published according to a scheduled production cycle (which may differ by account).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These stages will be scored as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>No compilation</li>\n  <li>Compilation</li>\n  <li>Dissemination</li>\n  <li>Regular compilation and dissemination</li>\n</ol>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sub-indicator (a)</strong>: Information is provided directly by Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity.

If a country does not respond, missing values will be imputed if the custodian agency can find evidence of implementation, such as online publications of SEEA accounts, or based on information gathered from international organizations on the compilation of SEEA accounts. In particular:</p>\n<p> -If a national statistical office or other government institution has published a SEEA account which is easily accessible online, this country will be imputed as compiling the SEEA. Since no assumption can be made that the country regularly compiles and publishes the account, this country would fall under Stage II.</p>\n<p> -If the custodian agency finds that a country compiles SEEA accounts through a project or other implementation programme and verifies this with the international organizations involved, this country will be imputed as compiling the SEEA under Stage I or Stage II as appropriate.</p>\n<p>In all cases, imputation is only be done as a secondary step after first contacting countries.
