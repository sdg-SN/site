Since then, these reports are collected every year, with a deadline of October 31 for submission by CITES Parties. Data reported through AITR have been processed and put together into the CITES Illegal Trade Database<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> in 2023-2024, and the database was launched in November 2023 and is now available for CITES Parties.</p>\n<p>As for the data collected for the World WISE database, these are collected in an ad-hoc basis based on sources availability and partnerships. Data from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), for example, are collected regularly and included into World WISE.</p>\n<p><u>Data for legal trade are collected by the CITES Secretariat through the CITES Annual Reports and processed by UNEP-WCMC on an annual basis. </u></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">2</sup><p> See <a href=\"https://citesdata.un.org/\"><u>https://citesdata.un.org/</u></a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>After a first submission of data in Q2 2024, data will be published annually in Q1. </p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Management Authority of each country provide data for both the CITES Legal and Illegal Trade Databases, through the Annual Reports and AITR. In addition, other sources are used for World WISE, such as the Environmental Investigation Agency, TRAFFIC, the World Customs Organization (WCO), amongst others.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for illegal trade data and United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) World Conservation Monitoring Centre for legal trade data.</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>Annual Reports (article VIII of the Convention) and AITR (Conf.11.17 &#x2013; Rev CoP19) are collected by the CITES Secretariat as per their mandate. CITES Secretariat works together with UNODC on the data processing for AITR data, and wile UNEP-WCMC for the processing of Annual Reports data.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<p>There are over 35,000 species under international protection, so it is impossible to monitor all poaching. Illegal trade, however, is an indirect indicator of poaching. Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances of illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable. In addition, the number of species under international protection continues to grow. Legal international trade in protected species, by definition, is 100% captured in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Trade Database, which now contains over 16 million records of trade in CITES-listed species. To ground the illegal trade data in a complete indicator, the ratio of aggregated seizures to total trade is estimated. An increase in the share of total wildlife trade that is illegal would be interpreted as a negative indicator, and a decrease as a positive one.</p>\n<p>Because the illegal wildlife trade represents thousands of distinct products, a means of aggregation is necessary. The legal trade value does not represent the true black market value of the items seized, nor the true value of the legal shipments, because it is derived from a single market source (US LEMIS). It does, however, present a logical and consistent means of aggregating unlike products.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>- Seizures are an incomplete indicator of trafficking, and subject to considerable volatility, and depend on external factors that may not be directly linked to the volume of flows, such as law enforcement priorities. </p>\n<p>- Universal coverage is not presently available, although data are available for a growing number of countries (see section 5). </p>\n<p>- Since the indicator looks at the relationship between two values (legal vs illegal trade), changes in the relationship could be due to changes in either value.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The value of a species-product unit is derived from the median price declared for legal imports of analogous species product units, as acquired from United States Law Enforcement Monitoring and Information System of the Fish and Wildlife Service (US LEMIS). Particularly, the median values for each TAXON/DESCRIPTION OF SPECIMEN/UNIT OF MEASUREMENT possible combination were used to assign a value to each legal trade and seizure record. Some additional sources (for cases where US LEMIS data were not available or were unreliable) were used, such as estimates based on field research from UNEP-WCMC and UNODC. Also, median values of combinations that were outliers, based on small sample sizes or had high variability were excluded from the calculations.</p>\n<p>The value of legal trade is the sum of all species-product units documented in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) export permits as reported in the CITES Annual Reports times the species-product unit prices as specified above.</p>\n<p>The value of illegal trade is the sum of all species-product units documented in the World WISE seizure and CITES Illegal Trade databases times the species-product unit prices as specified above.</p>\n<p>The indicator is defined as:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Data received go through a validation process that includes consistency checks, standardization of variables and conversion of measurement units. Due to the variety of sources involved, a deduplication process takes place, where records representing events identified as being reported by multiple sources are clustered, and only one is kept, to avoid double-counting. Large seizures are individually analysed to ensure there is no double-counting that could significantly affect totals.</p>\n<p>Finally, the data used are periodically shared with countries for their review as part of the process of &#x201C;pre-publication&#x201D; for UNODC World Wildlife Crime Reports (as done in October 2023), and the compiled 15.7.1 indicators are shared with countries for their review before submission to the United Nations Statistical Department (UNSD). </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For legal trade, data reported by other countries is used to impute the totals exported and imported at the national level.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As above</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries can provide data through the CITES.
