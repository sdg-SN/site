Similarly to sub-indicator &#x2018;&#x2019;trends in land cover&#x201D; under SDG Indicator 15.3.1 (Sims <em>et al.</em> 2021), mountain ecosystem degradation and recovery is assessed based on the definition of land cover type transitions that indicate improving, stable or degrading conservation status.

It defines total global mountain area as the sum of seven classes (commonly known as &#x2018;Kapos mountain classes&#x2019;), based on elevation, slope and local elevation ranges (Table 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Table 1.</strong> Global mountain classes as defined by UNEP-WCMC (2002)</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Kapos Mountain Class</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation &gt;= 4500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation &gt;= 3500 &amp; &lt; 4500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation &gt;= 2500 &amp; &lt; 3500 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation &gt;= 1500 &amp; &lt; 2500 meters &amp; slope &gt;= 2 degrees</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation&gt;= 1000 &amp; &lt; 1500 meters &amp; slope &gt;= 5 degrees OR local (7 km radius) elevation range &gt; 300 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 6</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Elevation &gt;= 300 &amp; &lt; 1000 meters &amp; local (7 km radius) elevation range &gt; 300 meters</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Class 7</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Inner isolated areas (&lt;=25 Km<sup>2</sup> in size) that do not meet criteria but surrounded by mountains</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Prior to the methodological refinement of this indicator approved by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDG) in June 2022, the UNEP-WCMC classification was used to disaggregate the indicator by Kapos mountain classes.

It includes vegetation and man-made features as well as bare rock, bare soil and inland water surfaces (FAO-GTOS, 2009). The primary units for characterizing land cover are categories (e.g. Forest or Open Water). These categories must be defined following a standardized land cover classification in order to identify land cover changes consistently over time. Several global standards of land cover classifications have been developed by international initiatives for this purpose. </p>\n<p>For the purposes of standardization and harmonization when reporting on SDG Indicator 15.4.2, this indicator has adapted the land cover classification established by the United Nations Statistical Commission&#x2019;s System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (UN-SEEA) (UN Statistical Division, 2014) by selecting the most relevant SEEA classes for mountain ecosystems and aggregating all croplands classes (Table 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Table 2.</strong> Left: Land cover classification established by the UN-SEEA (Source: UN Statistical Division, 2014).

FAO is the custodian UN agency for 21 SDG indicators, including 15.4.2.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Mountain ecosystems are important biodiversity centres that provide valuable ecosystem services to upstream and downstream areas. Yet, mountains are very fragile and impacted easily by both natural and anthropogenic factors. These can include climate change, unplanned agricultural expansion, unplanned urbanization, timber extraction, recreational activities and natural hazards such as landslides and flooding. The degradation of mountain ecosystems such as loss of the glacial cover, mountain biodiversity and green cover will affect the ability of the ecosystem to supply water downstream. The loss of forest and vegetative cover will reduce the ability of the ecosystem to retain soil and prevent landslides and flooding downstream. </p>\n<p>Therefore, monitoring mountain vegetation changes and its estimated impact in terms of ecosystem degradation and recovery provides information on the status of mountain ecosystems. Assessing the changes in land cover differentiated by bioclimatic belts is important in understanding the role that environmental factors, such as climate, play in explaining variations of mountain green cover across regions and helps to better interpret the direction of those changes. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator can be calculated using freely available Earth Observation data and simple Geographic Information Science (GIS) operations that can be processed in free and open source software (FOSS) GIS. Regional and global land cover data derived from Earth observation can play an important role in the absence of, to complement, or to enhance national official data sources. These datasets can help validate and improve national statistics for greater accuracy by ensuring that the data</p>\n<p>Recognizing that this indicator cannot fully capture the complexity of mountain ecosystems across the world, countries are strongly encouraged to use other relevant national or sub-national indicators, data and information to strengthen their interpretation, as well as taking into account the following limitations: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Sub-indicator &#x2018;&#x2019;a&#x2019;&#x2019; should be interpreted with care given that: 1) lack of green cover does not necessarily mean that a particular mountain area is degraded (i.e. areas of permanent snow and ice, scree slopes and natural sparsely vegetated areas above the tree line, 2) it does not capture significant drivers of change such as conversion of natural areas to cropland or pastureland, and 3) increase in green cover may due to impacts of climate change in mountain areas (i.e. increase in green cover due to snow and glacier retreat due to global warming). </li>\n  <li>Because land cover refers to the naturally stable aspects of land and the structure of its key elements, transient aspects such as vegetation phenology, snow or flooding cannot be captured by land cover transitions as measured in sub-indicator 15.4.2b. In the context of SDG Target 15.4, this is particularly relevant for snow cover dynamics (snow cover duration within a year), which has been highlighted as a key impact of global warming in mountain ecosystems with direct impacts to water provision (Notarnicola, 2020). </li>\n  <li>Decisions about which land cover transitions are linked to degradation processes would sometimes require information on the use of land, not only land cover. For example, the conversion of tree-covered areas to grassland may be a result of deforestation (change in land cover and land use) or just the result of certain management practices and natural disturbance (change in land cover only). The former could be identified as a negative transition, while the latter could be considered as stable or unchanging. The use of land use information would help to better characterize those changes in the context of sub-indicator &#x201C;b&#x2019;&#x2019;. </li>\n  <li>Both sub-indicators are not able to capture ecosystem degradation drivers that do not necessarily result in changes in land cover. Some examples of this include conversions of natural forests to intensively managed production systems such as plantation forests, orchards and oil palm plantations; conversion of natural and semi-natural grasslands to intensively used pastures, forest and grassland degradation or invasive species invasion, among others. However, the use of more detailed national land use maps may be able to overcome some of these gaps for sub-indicator 15.4.2b.</li>\n  <li>While access to remote sensing imagery has improved dramatically in recent years, there is still a need for essential historical time series that is currently only available at coarse to medium resolution. Therefore, if countries have national land cover maps of higher spatial resolution and comparable or better quality, FAO advises using them, following the same methodology presented here, for the generation of the indicator&#x2019;s values. </li>\n  <li>Area estimations based on remote-sensing-derived land cover maps such as the ESA-CCI product via pixel counting may lead to biased area estimates due to map errors (Olofsson et al. 2014). Countries are encouraged to further refine those estimates by comparing them against reference datasets and applying bias corrections.</li>\n</ul>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sub-indicator 15.4.2a</strong>, Mountain Green Cover Index, is defined as: </p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>M</mi>\n    <mi>G</mi>\n    <mi>C</mi>\n    <mi>I</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>M</mi>\n            <mi>o</mi>\n            <mi>u</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n            <mi>i</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>G</mi>\n            <mi>r</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>C</mi>\n            <mi>o</mi>\n            <mi>v</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>r</mi>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>A</mi>\n            <mi>r</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>M</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>A</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Mountain Green Cover Area<sub>n</sub> </em>= Sum of areas (in km<sup>2</sup>) covered by (1) tree-covered areas, (2) croplands, (3) grasslands, (4) shrub-covered areas and (5) shrubs and/or herbaceous vegetation, aquatic or regularly flooded classes in the reporting period <em>n.</em> </li>\n  <li><em>Total mountain area</em> = Total area of mountains (in km<sup>2</sup>).
