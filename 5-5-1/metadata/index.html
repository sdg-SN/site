In particular, the IPU has tracked the percentage of women in national parliaments since 1945 and is the authority for this data. See historical and comparative data on women in parliament at <a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/historical-women\">https://data.ipu.org/historical-women</a>. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision-making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public life and is linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 percent.</p>\n<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political, and economic future of societies.</p>\n<p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policies and legal measures to increase women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.</p>\n<p>- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events that are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.</p>\n<p>- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in the upper chambers of parliament. The information is available on the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) website at <a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking\">https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking</a>.</p>\n<p>- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women&#x2019;s contribution to political decision-making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The proportion of seats held by women in the national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament.</p>\n<p>There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat via IPU Groups within each parliamentary chamber or via the Parline Correspondent&#x2019;s Network. </p>\n<p>Parline Correspondents are staff members of national parliaments who act as the IPU focal point for IPU&#x2019;s Parline database within each chamber or parliament. Their main role is to make sure that all the data in Parline for their parliament is up&#x2011;to&#x2011;date and correct, including for this indicator. If no response is provided to questionnaires, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary websites, or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliaments. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p>No adjustments are made for missing values.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Regional aggregations are a simple sum of country and chamber level data. A weighting structure is not applied.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Guidance is not required to provide information for this indicator (i.e. current number of members and the total number of women members in a given single or lower chamber of a national parliament).</p>\n<p>A &#x201C;Checklist for Parline Correspondents&#x201D; is provided to remind parliaments to inform the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) of changes to the number of seats or the total number of women in a parliamentary chamber, every time there is a change.</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Data for this indicator is input and housed within the Parline database (data.ipu.org).</p>\n<p>The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has dedicated staff for data collection and management, a Network of Parline Correspondents to provide data updates and a constant exchange with parliaments via IPU groups housed within member parliaments.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>There is no significant statistical processing required for this indicator aside from checking coherence over time. </p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The Inter-Parliamentary Union&#x2019;s (IPU) data is housed within the Parline database which automatically generates calculations on the number and percentage of women to ensure accuracy. Exports from the database are utilised for SDG reporting.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Data are available for 193 countries. Information is available in all countries where a national legislature exists and therefore does not include parliaments that have been dissolved or suspended for an indefinite period.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) website the data extraction has changed over time as follows;</p>\n<p>2020 &#x2013; Present As at 1 January</p>\n<p>2013 &#x2013; 2019 As at 1 February</p>\n<p>1999 As at 5 February</p>\n<p>2002 As at 4 February</p>\n<p>2003, 2005 &#x2013; 2007, 2009 - 2012 As at 31 January</p>\n<p>2001, 2004 As at 30 January</p>\n<p>2008 As at 29 January</p>\n<p>1998, 2000 As at 25 January</p>\n<p>1997 As at 1 January</p>\n<p>Prior to 1997 Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator can be disaggregated for analysis by geographical region and sub-region, legislature type (single or lower, parliamentary or presidential), the method of filling seats (directly elected, indirectly elected, appointed), and the use of special measures.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Data are not adjusted for international comparability. Though, for international comparisons, generally only the single or lower house is considered in calculating the indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking\">https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif-arc.htm\">http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif-arc.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Inter-parliamentary Union (2008).
