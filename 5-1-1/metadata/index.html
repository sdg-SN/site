The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women&#x2019;s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup>. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex was needed.

</li>\n  <li>If personal law is a valid source of law under the constitution, is it invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on equality or non-discrimination? </li>\n  <li>Is there a discrimination law that prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination against women? </li>\n  <li>Do women and men enjoy equal rights and access to hold public and political office (legislature, executive, judiciary)? </li>\n  <li>Are there quotas for women (reserved seats) in, or quotas for women in candidate lists for, national parliament?</li>\n  <li>Do women and men have equal rights to confer citizenship to their spouses and their children?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Enforce and monitor </h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>Does the law establish a specialized independent body tasked with receiving complaints of discrimination based on gender (e.g., national human rights institution, women&#x2019;s commission, ombudsperson)?

</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Concepts: </h2>\n<p>Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women. Article 1 of CEDAW states: &#x201C;&#x2026; the term &quot;discrimination against women&quot; shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field&#x201D;. Article 2 of CEDAW states: States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>The term &#x201C;legal frameworks&#x201D; is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms, and policies/plans to &#x2018;promote, enforce and monitor&#x2019; gender equality. </p>\n<p>Legal frameworks that &#x201C;promote&#x201D; are those that establish women&#x2019;s equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination based on sex. Legal frameworks that &#x201C;enforce and monitor&#x2019; are directed to the realization of equality and non-discrimination and implementation of laws, such as policies/plans, the establishment of enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, and allocation of financial resources.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> The areas of law were agreed at the expert workshop, held on 14 and 15 June 2016, to discuss the methodological development of SDG indicator 5.1.1. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Percent (%) of legal frameworks that promote, enforce, and monitor gender equality</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The data for the indicator are derived from an assessment of legal frameworks using primary sources/official government documents, in particular laws, policies and action plans.

Since 2009, the World Bank Group&#x2019;s Women, Business and the Law project has contributed to the study of gender equality and informed discussions on improving women&apos;s economic opportunities and empowerment through a unique dataset that measures the legal differences in access to economic opportunities between men and women in 190 economies. </p>\n<p>The OECD Development Centre&#x2019;s core mission is to provide a platform for evidence-based policy dialogue between OECD and non-OECD countries to design better policies, by identifying policy solutions to improve lives in developing countries. Through its Gender Programme, particularly since the creation of the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) in 2009, the OECD Development Centre has played an instrumental role in highlighting the data gaps and fostering policy dialogue and mutual learning on the social institutions that discriminate against women and girls across their life cycle.

The five-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing +5) established 2005 as the target date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many countries. Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation persist.</p>\n<p>Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and achieving gender equality (Goal 5, Target 5.1).
