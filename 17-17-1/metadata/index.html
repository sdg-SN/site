The only adjustment that the data does is to account only once cross border projects, i.e. projects that involve more than one country and therefore have a unique project investment value. Cross border projects are counted for each country when data is presented at country level but only once when data is aggregated at regional or global level.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>&#x2022; Currently countries do not compile this indicator.

In addition, when data is released public ally, any project can be challenged in the website and therefore data will be reassessed and corrected if necessary.</li>\n  <li>No consultation project with countries on the national data is ongoing but the PPI database welcomes feedback and data contributors in the website.</li>\n</ul>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>The existing Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) database includes data on 6,400 projects over 28 years (1990-2023), with over 50 variables per project. It covers projects in 139 low and middle income countries as classified by the World Bank. The list of countries is reviewed every five years in order to maintain continuity in the data. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator is available since 1990 and data can be disaggregated on the monthly basis (i.e total investments in infrastructure PPP projects that reached financial closure in a particular month since 2000).</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>The unit of analysis is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project; therefore, data can be disaggregated at the project level.
