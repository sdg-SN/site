This responsibility varies and is country specific (i.e. Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for &#x201C;Exports of Goods, Services and Primary Income&#x201D; data are used for gap filling purposes. &#x201C;Exports of Goods, Services and Primary Income&#x201D; data are not reported directly to the World Bank from the national data provider. They are reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is the institution in charge of overseeing balance of payment stability as part of its institutional mandate.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>World Bank</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The World Bank has a mandate to collect accurate and timely public debt data to facilitate the effective discharge of its duties and to disseminate the data to the public, as collected through the Debtor Reporting System (DRS) and published in IDS. The data collection and dissemination mandate of the World Bank is based on the Bank Policy on &#x201C;<a href=\"https://ppfdocuments.azureedge.net/8fcc4c7a-0e1c-47e0-84b3-0950b0fc4d9b.pdf\">External Debt Reporting and Financial Statements</a>&#x201D;. This was amended in July 2005 and provides the institutional framework for the requirement that a borrowing or guaranteeing member country provides reliable and timely external debt data to the Bank. The Bank&#x2019;s General Conditions require such member country to &#x201C;furnish to the Bank all such information as the Bank shall reasonably request with respect to financial and economic conditions in its territory, including its balance of payments and external debt&#x201D;. As a condition of Board presentation of loans and credits, the borrowing country must submit a complete report (or an acceptable plan of action for such reporting) on its external debt.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The World Bank&#x2019;s rationale for collecting data on the external debt obligations of its borrowers comes from the need to ensure their debt servicing capacity and to support the assessment of their overall macroeconomic health. As a global public good, the World Bank disseminates aggregate data series derived from borrowers&#x2019; submissions on an annual basis to the Debtor Reporting System (DRS).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The methodologies for selected indicators follow long-established international standards as listed in 2.
