The custodian agencies collaborate with the World Bank, the CEQ Institute at University of Tulane, and other partners in collating and processing data.</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data compilation on the pro-poor social spending are the responsibilities undertaken by UNICEF and Save the Children in view of their mandate to assess policies and government efforts on behalf of families and children (UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 4).</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the extent to which public spending in three key areas which are critical for poverty eradication, including health, education, and other social transfers is directly allocated to individuals or households in the poorest 20%.</p>\n<p>Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is (a) equal or larger than 20%.</p>\n<p>This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies.</p>\n<p>In line with the SDG guidelines on data disaggregation, this indicator (where possible) should be disaggregated by gender, children, location (urban/rural), and political and administrative units.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Feasibility: The indicator can be estimated for any country for which (a) a micro-data set detailing incomes or expenditures and services utilization (i.e. education, health, and cash transfers receipts) at the individual or household level exists and (b) a set of fiscal, administrative, or budgetary records detailing public expenditures at the program level is available.</p>\n<p>Suitability/relevance: The indicator provides an estimate how well public resources are allocated to sectors which disproportionally benefit the poor. This reflects the financial consequences of policy frameworks, which are based on pro-poor development strategies, which allows to measure progress on the SDG target 1.b.</p>\n<p>Relationship with other SDGs: The indicator could be compared with the one under SDG 10 on equity of fiscal policy. Countries should be encouraged to collect and analyse the data within a single process to create synergy and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>\n<p>Limitations: The indicator does not take into effect the consequences of revenue-related fiscal activities, such as taxes or contributions to public insurance systems, on the poor.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><u>Population in the poorest 20% of households</u> can be derived directly from a nationally representative micro-data set (an Income and Expenditure Survey, for example).</p>\n<p><u>Public spending on social services</u> can be directly derived from budget administrative data.</p>\n<p>A fiscal incidence analysis is required to estimate the benefit the poor individuals or households (depending on underlying survey data) are receiving from those services. The incidence analysis measures the monetised value of in-kind transfers in education and health services at average government costs. In addition, this indicator includes cash and near cash transfers in the definition of social services (conditional and unconditional cash transfers, school feeding programmes etc.). The procedures are described in detailed in the CEQ Handbook, Meerman, Jacob (1979), Selowsky, Marcelo (1979), and many other ones.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Every year, UNICEF validates the latest data on all the SDG indicators UNICEF is custodian for. The validation process involves sharing the latest data (and metadata) of the indicators with SDG focal persons in each country, via the UNICEF Country Offices. Governments respond in writing accepting, rejecting or providing an alternative indicator.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>The indicator cannot be calculated when no nationally representative micro-data set and/or country-level fiscal, budgetary, and administrative data are available.
