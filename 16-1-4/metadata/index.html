It does so by limiting the area in question to the &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D; or &#x201C;area they live in&#x201D;. Various other formulations of local neighbourhood may be appropriate depending on cultural, physical and language context. Providing a universally applicable definition of neighborhood is challenging, as one&#x2019;s neighbourhood is a subjective concept that will mean different things to different people.<sup><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> </sup></p>\n<p>&#x201C;After dark&#x201D;- the indicator should specifically capture respondent&#x2019;s feelings and perceptions when walking alone after dark. The specific reference to darkness is important because according to research,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> darkness is one of the factors individuals perceive as important when assessing whether a situation is dangerous. While the specific reference to &#x201C;after dark&#x201D; is the preferrable wording and widely used in crime victimisation surveys,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> a suitable alternative wording is &#x201C;at night&#x201D;.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup> Specifying an exact time of the day (e.g. 6pm), however, is not advisable as darkness (not time of day per se) is the factor that affects individuals perception of safety, and cross-national as well as seasonal variation in the onset of darkness makes it problematic to establish a universally suitable threshold to define nighttime.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> Ferraro, K.

It is recommended that the sample size is sufficiently large to allow for disaggregation by age, gender, ethnicity, and other relevant covariates.</p>\n<p>The survey documentation should provide the specific wording used to collect data on perceptions of safety, enable the identification of possible discrepancies from standard definitions (e.g. no reference to &#x201C;after dark&#x201D; or &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D;), and allow an assessment of the overall data quality (e.g. sample size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection, etc.).</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>At the international level, data are routinely collected by UNODC through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. As requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 140 Member States have appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that submits UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once consolidated, data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and validity.</p>\n<p>The UN-CTS provides specific definitions of data to be collected.

It does so through several Global programmes and through the UNODC field office network.</p>\n<p>UNODC is responsible for carrying out the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), which was introduced through the General Assembly Resolution <a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)\">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972. The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984, further requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Perception of safety is considered a subjective wellbeing indicator. It affects the way in which human beings interact with their surroundings, their health, and consequently, their quality of life. Indicator 16.1.4 taps into the concept of &#x2018;fear of crime&#x2019;, which has been elicited in dozens of crime victimization surveys, and the standard formulation used here has been shown to be applicable in different cultural contexts.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup> It is important to note that fear of crime is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that fear of crime may be even largely independent from actual experience. The perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is influenced by several factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion, the media discourse, and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, fear of crime is an important indicator in itself as high levels of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and engagement in the community, and thus represent an obstacle to development. Fear of crime also differs across demographic groups and this indicator helps to identify vulnerable groups.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 56. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age).</p>\n<p>There are several limitations associated with the wording of the survey question used to measure fear of crime (&#x2018;How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood after dark?&#x2019;). First, the question assumes that respondents do the following: (1) go out, (2) go out alone, (3) go out in their neighbourhood, and (4) go out after dark. For many respondents, the reasons for not going out alone in their neighbourhood after dark may have nothing or little to do with crime and more to do with personal and circumstantial issues, such as lack of mobility, childcare commitments, or the use of a car that allows them to travel further afield. Second, the question does not define the meaning of &#x201C;neighbourhood&#x201D;, which may mean different things to different respondents, even those living in the same street. Third, the question does not explicitly refer to &#x2018;crime&#x2019;, but rather it is implicit in the question. There may be other reasons unrelated to crime (e.g. wild animals, traffic, etc.) why respondents may not feel safe walking around their neighbourhood after dark.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-7\">6</sup><p> UNODC-UNECE (2010) Manual on Victimization Surveys, p. 57. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The question used in victimization surveys is: How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood after dark?<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup> Answer options are typically: (1) Very safe, (2) safe, (3) unsafe (4), very unsafe, (5) I never go out alone at night/does not apply, (99) don&#x2019;t know.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-ref-9\">[8]</a></sup> The proportion of population that feel safe is calculated by summing up the number of respondents who feel &#x201C;very safe&#x201D; and &#x201C;safe&#x201D; and dividing the total by the total number of respondents, and multiplying by 100.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mn>16</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mo>.</mo>\n    <mn>4</mn>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>N</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>w</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>w</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>k</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>h</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>v</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>X</mi>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> This question is intended to capture respondents&#x2019; perception of safety when thinking about crime, although it does not explicitly mention crime or prime respondents to think about crime.
