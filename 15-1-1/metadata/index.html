Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.</li>\n  <li>It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.</li>\n  <li>It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.</li>\n  <li>It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.</li>\n  <li>It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless of whether this area is classified as land area or not.</li>\n  <li>It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.</li>\n  <li>It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.</li>\n  <li>It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the &#x201C;Taungya&#x201D; system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><u>Land area</u></strong> is the country area excluding area under inland waters and coastal waters.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Country area</strong>: Area under national sovereignty.

The availability of accurate data on a country&apos;s forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development.</p>\n<p>Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural sector.</p>\n<p>Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are sustainably managed.</p>\n<p>The indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG indicator</p>\n<p>7.1 &#x201C;Proportion of land covered by forest&#x201D;).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries. Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation of forest area using remote sensing techniques has certain challenges. In particular the assessment of forest area relates to land use, while remote sensing primarily assesses land cover. Furthermore, gradual changes, such as forest regrowth, require several years to become detectable in satellite imagery. In addition, forest areas with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are still difficult to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing techniques.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>F</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mo>(</mo>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mo>)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>L</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mo>(</mo>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>f</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi>y</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mo>)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>All data submitted by countries to FRA, including the FAO estimates made in case of desk studies, are available at the FRA online platform (<a href=\"https://fra-data.fao.org/\">https://fra-data.fao.org/</a>).

FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO&#x2019;s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary.

Quality dimensions definitions are provided in the FAO Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF), which provides the definition of quality and describes quality principles for statistical outputs; statistical processes; institutional environment (http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf). The SQAF is based on the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the Principles Governing International Statistical Activities (CCSA).
