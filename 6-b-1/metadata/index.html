The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on community and user participation has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to address all targets in SDG 6, including water quality, water rights/allocation, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. </p>\n<p>National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.</p>\n<p>The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). A key component of IWRM is community participation and management of water resources at the local level. The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).</p>\n<p>The OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI), a technical platform gathering 100+ members from the public, private and non-for-profit sectors, is currently developing a set of Water Governance Indicators, within the implementation strategy of the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD 2015a). The Water Governance Indicators are expected to be able to provide additional information on local participation on the basis of an indicators system proposed in OECD (2015b) for measuring &#x201C;stakeholder engagement for inclusive water governance&#x201D;. An indicator providing metrics on local participation will be developed and tested by 2017. Data will be made available through interactive platforms and databases in a format to foster policy dialogue and peer learning by 2018. A dedicated publication on &#x201C;Water Governance at a Glance&#x201D; will be launched at the 8th World Water Forum in Brasilia (2018).</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country processes are collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.) Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts.</p>\n<p>Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual, validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>The current round of UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) has been launched and data will be available by end-2016.

For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.</p>\n<p>Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the highly country- and context-specific nature of the indicator, no estimates are produced for countries that are missing data.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>Operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to water and sanitation management then the country will be excluded from the regional and global estimates for this indicator. </p>\n<p>Global and regional estimates for a related indicator on the presence and use of participation policies and procedures at the national level for different water subsectors are also derived to support the target indicator.
