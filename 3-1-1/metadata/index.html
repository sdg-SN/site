Forthcoming releases from 2022 onwards will transition to use ICD-11 coding.

This database is updated before the release of every new round of estimates and is used to calculate the proportion of maternal deaths (PM) among women of reproductive age (WRA). The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where &quot;D&quot; is the number of all-cause deaths among women WRA and &quot;B&quot; is the number of live births.

It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. </p>\n<p>In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15&#x2013;49 years.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.</p>\n<p>The MMR can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths.

There is also some evidence from community studies that women with HIV infection have a higher risk of maternal death, although this may be offset by lower fertility. If HIV is prevalent, there will also be more incidental HIV deaths among pregnant and postpartum women. When estimating maternal mortality in these countries, it is, thus, important to differentiate between incidental HIV deaths (non-maternal deaths) and HIV-related indirect maternal deaths (maternal deaths caused by the aggravating effects of pregnancy on HIV) among HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women who have died (i.e. among all HIV-related deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium).</p>\n<p>The number of HIV-related indirect<strong><em> </em></strong>maternal deaths <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>H</mi>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n  </math>, is estimated by:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msup>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>D</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>H</mi>\n        <mi>I</mi>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msup>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mo>&#x2219;</mo>\n    <mi>E</mi>\n    <mo>&#x2219;</mo>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mo>&#x2219;</mo>\n    <mi>u</mi>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where: </p>\n<p>a*E = the total number of HIV-related deaths among all deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49.</p>\n<p><em>v = </em>is the proportion of HIV-related deaths to women aged 15&#x2013;49 that occur during pregnancy.

Adjustments are applied to pregnancy-related deaths to account for these non-maternal deaths.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Adjustment for crisis years:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proportion of pregnancy-related deaths among the deaths attributable to mortality shock from crisis is assumed to be equal to the proportion of women in the population who are pregnant or postpartum at the time of the crisis. The proportion of pregnant women in the population is set equal to the general fertility rate, based on the assumption of a one-year period associated with a live birth. Additional uncertainty is added to the estimates of crisis years.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Adjustment for age distribution in population-based surveys:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Population-based surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) obtain information by interviewing respondents about the survival of their siblings. This approach, commonly referred to as the direct sisterhood method. Given the study design (based on sisters of respondents), the population exposed to risk may be atypical of the population at large. Therefore, we compute an age-standardized value of PM, based on the female population of households at the time of the survey.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Adjustment for underreporting (unregistered) and misclassification in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Underreporting and misclassification in CRVS systems are accounted for with specialized studies.

However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (UN MMEIG) first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the &#x201C;proportion maternal&#x201D;, or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. </p>\n<p>In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:</p>\n<p>PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 </p>\n<p>and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:</p>\n<p>MMR=PM &#xD7; (All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)</p>\n<p>Where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO Global Health Estimates life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 2019.</p>\n<p>With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.</li>\n  <li>The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined &#x201C;maternal&#x201D; deaths; misclassification; or incompleteness). </li>\n  <li>The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2022, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the United Nations Population Division: the contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly, and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. </li>\n  <li>Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk</li>\n</ol>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240068759\">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240068759</a></p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2020: estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group and UNDESA/Population Division.
