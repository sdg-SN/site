Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities.

Depending on the frequency of release of remittance volumes, quarterly or annual data can be used. Furthermore, data gathered from governments&#x2019; bodies, such as the Central Bank and National Statistical Offices, are often useful to complement the data reported in BOP. The scope and capacity for standardized data collection is expected to rise with progressive data collection and implementation of the methodology.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>This is done on an annual basis.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>No fixed releases; depends on release of the latest balance of payments data.</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>The national data provider of personal remittances is the institution in charge of the collection and compilation of the Balance of Payments statistics. This responsibility varies and is country specific (i.e. Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for personal remittances data are used for gap-filling purposes.

They are reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is the institution in charge of overseeing balance of payment stability as part of its institutional mandate. </p>\n<p>GDP data are sourced from the World Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators (WDI) database and are compiled in accordance to the System of National Accounts, 2008 (2008 SNA) methodology.

Even though many countries implemented direct reporting and dedicated models to estimate remittances flows, there are challenges in accurately measuring and compiling remittance data. Problems include, but are not limited to, countries&#x2019; adoption of heterogeneous concepts and definitions heterogeneously, deficiencies in coverage and scope, and discrepancies in gross/net recordings for components such as the compensation of employees. Accurate data on remittance flows is crucial for policymakers, governments, and international organizations to develop effective strategies for to promoting sustainable development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The accurate measurement and compilation of remittance data continue to pose challenges for several reasons. </p>\n<p>(i) Remittance transactions through unofficial channels: A significant portion of remittances flows through informal channels, such as cash hand-carried by migrants when they return home. These transactions are difficult to track and often go unrecorded in official statistics. Furthermore, digitalization through Fintech solutions have significantly impacted the remittance industry but are difficult to track. Data on mobile wallets that receive remittances as well as blockchain and cryptocurrencies to facilitate cross-border remittances have yet to be incorporated into countries&#x2019; data compilation frameworks. </p>\n<p>(ii) Inadequate adherence to the residency concept: With increasing numbers of refugees, including transit migrants (who do not establish permanent residency in their transit countries) as well as the new phenomenon of remote workers with dual residency status, further clarification and practical guidelines are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage. </p>\n<p>(iii) Misclassification: Classifications used for remittance statistics are often not in conformity with guidelines outlined in the IMF&#x2019;s Remittances Guide for Compilers or its Balance of Payments Manual (RCG/BPM6). Some non-remittance transactions, travel revenues and expenditures, or inward direct investment flows are often misclassified as inward remittances. And small trade payments, gifts to charitable organizations, or bank deposits are also sometimes misclassified as personal remittances, further complicating data accuracy.</p>\n<p>(iv) Incompatibility of source data: There are several key limitations in the source data, including its lack of comprehensiveness, susceptibility to country-specific conditions, and incompleteness for proper transaction classification according to defined criteria in terms of scope, classifications, valuation, and required timing of recording.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Personal remittances are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF&apos;s Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees.
