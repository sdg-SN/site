In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is classified as &quot;outside biologically sustainable levels&quot;.</p>\n<p>A wide array of methods and approaches (including documented expert opinion) is used to classify stock status relative to the abundance producing MSY. This varies among countries, regions and stocks. Nevertheless, the reliability of the classification is assessed by FAO as part of the process of producing the index.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)</strong> is commonly defined as the greatest average amount of catch that can be harvested in the long-term from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock), without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. A stock can produce MSY if its abundance is above a certain level, usually around 50% of its unexploited abundance (but actual value can vary around that level, depending on the biological characteristics of the stock). See more at <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21\">https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21</a></p>\n<p>MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)). For more on Reference Points in Fish Stock Assessment, see Caddy and Mahon (1995), Cadima (2003) or Haddon (2011).</p>\n<p><strong>BMSY</strong>: Biomass corresponding to Maximum Sustainable Yield from a production model or from an age-based analysis using a stock recruitment model. Often used as a biological reference point in fisheries management, it is the calculated long-term average biomass value expected if fishing at FMSY.</p>\n<p><strong>A population is:</strong> &#x201C;A group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time and sharing a common gene pool, with little or no immigration or emigration.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>A biological stock is: </strong>&#x201C;A subpopulation of a species inhabiting a particular geographic area, having similar biological characteristics (e.g. growth, reproduction, mortality) and negligible genetic mixing with other adjacent subpopulations of the same species.&quot; (FAO, 2004-2021).</p>\n<p>The <strong>reference list of Stocks:</strong> it is not possible to classify the sustainability of exploitation for all the exploited stocks from a country, region or the world. Therefore, the indicator must be calculated based on a subset of these stocks. The list of the stocks that are classified for status and used to calculate the indicators is called the &quot;reference list of Stocks&quot;.</p>\n<p>The reference list of Stocks is built differently for the Regional/Global and the National levels. The process of building the reference list of Stocks for regional and global level are described in FAO (2011). At National level, countries are requested to define a list of stocks, based on an agreed set of criteria (Appendix 1). National and shared stocks can be included, but not straddling stocks (stocks that are distributed both in national EEZ and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>At this moment, there is not a direct correspondence between the national level reference lists (that are defined by each country) and the regional and global Reference lists (that are defined by FAO).</p>\n<p>FAO is working on an update of its methodology at global/regional level (FAO, 2024) which also addresses needs for convergence with the national level.

The data to inform stock assessments can come from many different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. They can include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats, number of tows, time spent on the sea, as well as economic and social information like fish prices, fuel expenditures, total sales, employment or other.</p>\n<p>Fishery-independent data are obtained in ways not related to any fishing activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often scientific cruises) designed to estimate species abundance and biomass over long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically, fisheries-independent data also include biological information on the species (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).</p>\n<p>These data and other information are used by stock assessment scientists to classify the stock status. References on the methods most commonly used can be found in Cadima (2003), Haddon (2011), Sparre and Venema (1998) and other publications dealing with the methods of stock assessment.</p>\n<p>The information used for the indicator at the Global/Regional level is based on a different process and data sources than that used for the national level.</p>\n<p>Global/Regional:</p>\n<p>Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods, only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account for ca 50 percent of the global catch (Hilborn et al., 2020), and most are caught by industrial fisheries in developed countries. To balance the global representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best available information, FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80 percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2011).</p>\n<p>National:</p>\n<p>The national level indicator, on the other hand, is based exclusively on the stock status reported by countries. A multiplicity of methods are used to classify the stock status, including model-based estimates, empirical indicators and documented expert opinion.</p>\n<p>For country reporting, a questionnaire is sent out to all FAO member states with marine boundaries (i.e. 165 states, 11 territories, and three Caspian Sea border countries) on a two-year basis. For the most recent and complete list of questions used to inform this indicator, please visit <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/faoweb/statistics/questionnaires/SDG_14.4.1_questionnaire_2022_en.xlsx\">https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/faoweb/statistics/questionnaires/SDG_14.4.1_questionnaire_2022_en.xlsx</a> .</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>At this moment, data collection is separate for the national and regional/global levels.</p>\n<p>Global/regional level: </p>\n<p>The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify relevant stock status information (FAO 2011).</p>\n<p>National level: </p>\n<p>FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organizes an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. </p>\n<p>During the initial stages of national data reporting, the information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform the indicator for the individual countries, also acknowledging the need for a learning curve along the few first questionnaire inquiries. As a result, the global/regional indicator remains separate from the national indicators during these initial stages. However, FAO is working on a convergence (where possible) of the two processes, and good-quality stock status assessments reported by countries for the national indicators will be included in the regional/global indicator calculations, depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years.</p>\n<p>Despite this effort, due to the heterogeneity of reporting from countries in the same FAO Major Fishing Area, and the necessary inclusion of straddling and highly migratory stocks and fisheries in the regional and global indicator, it is unlikely that a full convergence will be achieved in a short time-frame.</p>\n<p>The indicator is applicable for countries with marine borders (or those bordering the Caspian Sea) and therefore excludes landlocked countries from data collection and processing. </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>National : Reporting every 2 years beginning in November 2019.</p>\n<p>Global/regional: every 2 years since 2013.

Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.&#x201D;</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies. As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavours to provide the international community with the best information on the state of marine fishery resources.</p>\n<p>Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical models to data-limited approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period 2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd IAEG-SDG in October 2015.</p>\n<p>The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed &#x201C;FAO Major Fishing Areas&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>The Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, FAO works to put in action the 2030 Agenda&#x2019;s emphasis on country ownership and raise the incentive to take action at country, regional and global levels. FAO has developed, since 2019, a questionnaire approach to allow individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at the global/regional levels (FAO, 2011), and 2) provides countries with simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional methods have presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ and/or shared with neighbouring countries&#x2019; EEZs, and therefore do not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. </p>\n<p>In 2019, FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and as an end-result, is a measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires catch and fishing effort data and/or other biological or technical data and parameters together with the scientific expertise necessary to correctly perform stock assessment. The indicator at the global level is estimated by FAO based on methodology developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends.</p>\n<p>For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking countries&#x2019; own progress over time. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>FAO currently reports the global and regional indicators calculated from FAO&#x2019;s assessment of a selected reference list of fish stocks around the world.

The validation process consists of: (i) identification of errors, mistakes and missing values in the data and, (ii) correcting errors, mistakes and missing values in close consultation with the countries concerned. Each country is asked either to confirm that the data provided are correct or to provide remarks and / or revise data accordingly if they identify any errors.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>No adjustments were applied for the time series</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x25CF; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure completeness of regional and global information on stocks, FAO gathers additional information outside of what is provided by each country, in particular concerning the highly migratory and straddling fish stocks. For shared stocks, FAO may consult with regional fisheries bodies (RFBs), who are mandated to assess and manage stocks with their contracting parties, in order to receive information and data and conduct stock assessments when necessary. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x25CF; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>This indicator examines marine fish stocks. If a country has no marine capture fisheries, then the indicator is not calculated for that country and FAO reports it to UNSD with the flag &#x201C;N&#x201D; (Not relevant), with the exception of countries surrounding the Caspian Sea. When data are missing at the national level, no imputation is performed to derive estimates. The indicator at regional and global levels was estimated not based on country questionnaires, but by FAO through a systematic assessment of a reference list of stocks selected globally. </p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>As explained in the &#x201C;Rationale&#x201D; section, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country&#x2019;s EEZ (including stocks shared with neighbouring countries&#x2019; EEZs), and will therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Therefore, regional &#x201C;aggregates&#x201D; by FAO Major Fishing Area and the global indicator value are calculated with a specific approach, as described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011).</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>In each country, the data available for each stock and expertise level to conduct different types of assessments will differ. Some countries may have classic stock assessments already conducted for many of their stocks, while others may have very few or no assessments available. </p>\n<p>For some countries, little stock assessment has been done. To help these countries and to facilitate their reporting, FAO prepared online materials and tools, including a selection of methods that can be used to evaluate stock status with data limited methods such as length-based and catch-only methods and an online platform for hands-on practice. The strengths and limitations of these methods are discussed in an eLearning course<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> (Lesson 4), and caveats were also provided to avoid misuse and encourage caution in their use. Furthermore, capacity development workshops have been organized to provide support to countries in stock assessment and reporting on the Indicator SDG 14.4.1.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p>eLearning course: <a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-4\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>FAO has in place the necessary frameworks and procedures for quality assurance of the SDG indicators data, according to the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF) available at: <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FAO is systematically carrying out quality assessments to ensure the quality of the SDG indicator data sets. </p>\n<p>For this indicator, a systematic cross-checking of the various source data was carried out during the overall compilation process of national and regional data.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>FAO carries out a quality assurance review to help with consistency and correctness of this reporting process. The review is performed in two steps to quantify the level of confidence that can be attributed to national reporting: 1) to verify that the questionnaire has been correctly and sufficiently filled out and complies with the reporting guidelines, and 2) to assess the reliability of the responses relative to the supporting information reported by the country. Reliability is based on the compliance to the guidelines in developing the reference list of stocks, the proportion of stocks with official assessments, the source of stock assessments (e.g. RFB, peer-reviewed, expert knowledge), the amount of data available at the stock level, and the consistency with regional assessments (for shared stocks). FAO provides feedback to respondents, who have an opportunity to adjust their submission. </p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Quality assessment reveals that quality is highly dependent on the primary data which undergoes the applicable validation procedures before dissemination. The outcomes of the calculations are also controlled and compared inside and among FAO fishing areas. Global and regional aggregates are assessed by considering and evaluating the contributions of regional fisheries bodies while ensuring consistency of the entire time series for the global indicator, with reference to the published methodology (FAO, 2011). In addition, an internal summary report on the annual assessment of the quality of country data is also produced.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Global/regional: the indicator has global and regional data on a biennial basis from 1974 to 2021. Regional breakdown is by FAO major fishing area. The regional and global indicators were calculated based on the reference list of fish stocks FAO established in 1974. Countries are not directly involved in the computation of the indicator at global/regional level. </p>\n<p>National: the national-level questionnaire was dispatched for the first time in November 2019 and then on a biennial basis since 2022; FAO identifies 165 countries with a marine border, 11 territories with a marine border, and three countries with Caspian Sea border, as being eligible, in principle, to report.

Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list of stocks. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the global indicator&#x2019;s temporal trends, which covers 75% of global landings.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL: </strong></p>\n<h2>FAO 2016-2021.

This list of fish stocks will ideally include existing assessment units or management units, and also possibly other unassessed fish stocks that are fished in a given country. The list will exclude stocks straddling in the high seas, mostly tuna and tuna-like species.</p>\n<p>This list should:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Include finfish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic animals, and exclude aquatic mammals, reptiles, seaweeds and other aquatic plants;</li>\n  <li>Represent at least 60% (a higher percent is preferred when possible) of the national total landed and/or reported catch (Total in Tonnes excluding landings from straddling stocks). Information should be provided on all of the stocks that contribute to this top 60% (or more) of landings regardless of whether their status is known. Stocks should be input from left to right on the spreadsheet in the order of the largest to smallest total landings for each stock, by Tonnes. Species with multiple different stocks should be input as separate stocks. </li>\n  <li>Contain stocks of major importance in terms of catch, ecosystem role, economic value, historical importance, representative geographic distribution, stocks from both industrial and artisanal fisheries, and social/cultural considerations. If possible, the list should represent stocks of each of these categories for a given country. For example, care should be taken to include fish stocks that are important to small-scale fisheries as well as large-scale industrial fisheries. Consideration for these different categories will vary between countries.</li>\n  <li>Remain unchanged (i.e. for at least 5 years) to better reflect changes in stock status at the national level and minimize the effect of changing the reference list of stocks (i.e., adding, deleting, merging stocks) into the SDG indicator. This will ensure consistency in the indicator calculation and better reflect fish stock sustainability over time.</li>\n</ol>","target_number":"14.4","goal_number":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-04-01"};
