Wasting can however also be assessed with mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on MUAC are not considered for the JME joint database. In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting with bilateral pitting oedema (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs). For surveys that report wasting including oedema cases, these are included in the prevalence of low weight-for-height in the JME database unless raw data are available for re-analysis. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Proportion</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/who-multicentre-growth-reference-study\">WHO 2006</a>) generated a growth standard for assessing the growth and development of infants and young children around the world. The MGRS collected primary growth data and related information from children from widely different ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the USA). The resulting growth standard can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding. The indicator refers to those moderately or severely wasted, that is with a z-score below -2 standard deviations from the median weight-for-length/height of the growth standard. </p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>For the majority of countries, nationally representative household surveys constitute the data source. For a limited number of countries data from administrative (routine) and surveillance systems is used if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%). For all data sources, the child&#x2019;s length/height and weight measurements have to be collected following recommended standard measuring techniques (<a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/\">WHO/UNICEF 2019</a>).</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group jointly review new data sources to update the country level estimates. Each agency uses their existing mechanisms for obtaining data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working at national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely provide technical support for the collection and analysis of nutrition data. UNICEF also relies on a data source catalogue that is regularly updated using data sources from catalogues of other international organizations and national statistics offices. This data collection is done in close collaboration with UNICEF regional offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. The regional office staff work with country offices and local counterparts to ensure all relevant data are shared.</p>\n<p>WHO data gathering strongly relies on the organization&#x2019;s structure and network established over the past 30 years, since the creation of its global database, the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, in the late 1980&#x2019;s (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15542535/\">de Onis et al. 2004</a>).</p>\n<p>The World Bank Group provides estimates available through the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which usually requires re-analysis of datasets given that the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the child malnutrition data.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Data collection is carried out by the three-agency group regularly throughout the year so that data are available for the SDG report and database.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>The UNICEF-WHO-WB Joint Child Malnutrition (JME) group releases country, regional and worldwide estimates at the end of March every other year so that data are available for the SDG report and database. The JME group also maintains a database of primary data sources (e.g., household surveys), that is used to generate the JME global and regional estimates.</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>Most data sources are nationally representative household surveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and National Nutrition Surveys (NNS). Some data come from other sources (e.g., administrative, sentinel systems or national information systems).</p>\n<p>Data providers vary and most commonly are ministries of health, national offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing of children. UNICEF actively supports countries in data collection and analysis for reporting on child malnutrition indicators primarily through high-quality MICS surveys, as well as providing technical and financial support to other surveys. UNICEF not only supports household surveys but also works with global partners to define technical standards for the collection and analysis of anthropometric data. UNICEF also compiles statistics on child nutrition with the goal of making internationally comparable estimates and databases publicly available. In-depth analyses of the data on child malnutrition, which are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship publication, <em>The State of the World&#x2019;s Children,</em> and the <em>Child Nutrition Report</em> are also conducted by UNICEF.</p>\n<p>WHO has an established role in the monitoring of child growth and malnutrition since the late 1980&#x2019;s and had the mandate to develop the WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in 2006, and adopted by more than 160 countries. WHO published several peer-reviewed articles with regional and global estimates until 2012, when they joined forces with UNICEF and the World Bank, with the objective of harmonizing child malnutrition estimates. WHO has the mandate to monitor and report progress on the six global nutrition targets, endorsed in 2012 by the World Health Assembly, amongst them, three on child malnutrition, namely stunting, overweight and wasting (SDG 2.2.1, 2.2.2 (1) and 2.2.2 (2)).</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status and well-being. Child wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Survey estimates have uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). While non-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when available, a data quality review of weight, height and age data<u> </u>from household surveys supports compilation of a time series that is comparable across countries and over time. </p>\n<p>Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. This indicator can be affected by seasonality; factors related to food availability (e.g., pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g., rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and natural disasters and conflicts can impact wasting. Hence, country-year estimates may not necessarily be comparable over time. Consequently, only latest estimates are provided for country-level.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards as described in <em>Recommendations for data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years old</em> (<a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/resources/data-collection-analysis-reporting-on-anthropometric-indicators-in-children-under-5/\">WHO/UNICEF 2019</a>) and WHO Anthro Survey Analyser (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software\">WHO, 2019</a>). The current methodology used by JME has been published in 2024 (<a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/resources/jme-standard-methodology/\">JME Methods 2024</a>).</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank undertake a joint review for each potential data source (e.g., household survey). The group conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological details and results is available, as well as (ideally) a data quality assessment flagging potential limitations. When the raw data are available, they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is conducted. Comments are documented in a standard review template that includes methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and malnutrition prevalence estimates generated by standard, recommended methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well as against those from other data sources already included in the JME database, to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point. Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is available. Country consultations with SDG 2.2 focal points are also held every two years before finalizing and disseminating each edition of the JME estimates. The purpose of the country consultations is to ensure the wasting estimates include all recent and relevant country data and to engage with and receive feedback from national governments on the estimates. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Adjustments to reported values are made in cases where raw data are not available for re-analysis and it is known from the report that the estimates were derived based on indicators that do not adhere to the standard definition used for monitoring of the SDGs (e.g., they are based on different growth references). The three types of adjustments that have been applied to the JME country dataset include adjustments to standardize for: (i) area of residence, specifically for data sources that were only nationally representative at the rural level; (ii) growth reference, specifically for data sources that used the 1977 NCHS/WHO Growth Reference instead of the 2006 WHO Growth Standards to generate the child malnutrition estimates; and (iii) age, specifically for data sources that did not include the full 0&#x2013;59-month age group (e.g., data sources reporting on 2&#x2013;4-year-olds). These three types of adjustments are described further in this section.</p>\n<p><strong>i. Adjustment from national rural to national</strong></p>\n<p>A number of surveys cover only rural areas, and, while they have been sampled to be nationally representative for the rural parts of the country, they did not sample any urban areas. Given that malnutrition prevalence generally varies between urban and rural areas (i.e., stunting prevalence was reported to be two times higher in rural areas compared to urban areas at the global level (5)), a rural-only survey would not be comparable with a national survey that are representative of both urban and rural areas. To improve comparability of the rural-only data sources for the specific country, it is necessary to account for urban populations in estimates from these surveys. </p>\n<p>The adjustment method used by the JME group is to apply the relative proportions of malnutrition prevalence for each urban and rural area from the closest survey in the country&#x2019;s JME dataset that includes disaggregated estimates by area of residence, to the survey that covers only rural areas. This is done under the assumption that the urban:rural population ratio remains the same as the survey with the disaggregations available (e.g., the proportion of children living in rural areas in the country is the same in the survey year used for the adjustment as in the survey year being adjusted) and also that relative prevalence of malnutrition across urban-rural areas in the survey with the missing data is the same as in the survey with full information used for the adjustment. </p>\n<p><strong>ii. Adjustment to use the 2006 WHO Growth Standard (converted estimates):</strong></p>\n<p>The indicators of stunting, wasting and overweight used to track SDG Target 2.2 require a standard deviation (SD) score (z-score) to be calculated for each child who is measured for a data source; and the z-score requires a growth reference against which it can be calculated. Prior to the release of the WHO Child Growth Standards in 2006, the 1977 NCHS/WHO reference was recommended for international comparisons. The WHO Growth Standard results in estimates of stunting and wasting prevalence that are higher as well as estimates of overweight that are lower than estimates generated using the NCHS/WHO growth reference (6). It was therefore necessary to account for these differences and standardize estimates across data sources. As such, data sources published prior to the release of the new growth standard in 2006 had to be re-analysed using the 2006 growth standards to obtain comparable estimates across time and location. When raw data were not available, a standard algorithm was applied to convert estimates from surveys based on the NCHS reference to estimates based on the WHO Growth Standards (7). </p>\n<p><strong>iii. Age-adjustment</strong></p>\n<p>A limited number of surveys in the JME country database of primary sources that do not have microdata report on age groups that do not cover the entire 0&#x2013;59-month age range in the standard definition for stunting, wasting and overweight. Adjustment for age is needed as malnutrition prevalence can vary by sub-age group. For example, stunting prevalence among children 24&#x2013;59 months old in recent surveys with age-disaggregation were more than two times higher than the stunting prevalence among children 0&#x2013;5 months old (8). Surveys that omit part of the full age range might thus not be comparable with a survey that did cover all children aged 0&#x2013;59-months. Age adjustment can thus help to properly assess the country trend. Similar to the adjustment for rural-only surveys, the proportion of children with malnutrition in the two sub-age groups is assumed to be the same in the survey years in question.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>No imputation methodology is applied to derive estimates for countries or years where no data are available.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and worldwide levels</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Countries and years are treated as missing randomly following a multilevel modelling approach (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15542535/\">de Onis et al. 2004</a>).</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Regional aggregates are available for the following classifications: UN, SDG, UNICEF, WHO, The World Bank regions and income groups.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Methods and guidance: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241515559\">Recommendations for data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years of age (WHO/UNICEF, 2019)</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"file:///C:\\Users\\KWELKEMA\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\A1DL2518\\The%20UNICEF-WHO-World%20Bank%20Joint%20Child%20Malnutrition%20Estimates%20(JME)%20standard%20methodology\">The UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates (JME) standard methodology (2024)</a></p>\n<p>Analysis tool: <a href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/anthro/\">WHO Anthro Survey Analyser (shinyapps.io)</a></p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The JME working group, which was formed in 2011 with representatives from UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank, is responsible for management of the processes used to develop regular updates of the JME estimates.

The JME review form is used to abstract key information including methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometry equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., response rates, weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as having implausible anthropometry outcomes according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates from each primary data source (e.g., household survey) under review. One JME working group member fills in the review form for each data source and when information is missing or further details are required, the country teams are contacted. Once all information is available and the JME primary data source review form is completed, each data source is reviewed by the three agencies which form the JME working group.
