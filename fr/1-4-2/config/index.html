An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup>, cooperative or other type of association. </p>\n<p><strong>Secure tenure rights</strong>: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security. </p>\n<p><strong>Legally recognized documentation</strong>: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official. For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale).</p>\n<p><strong>Perceived security of tenure</strong>: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual&#x2019;s perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights&#x2019; documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context.</p>\n<p>For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and </li>\n  <li>The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em>Total adult population:</em></strong> A country&#x2019;s adult population<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sampling frame.</p>\n<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>\n<p>One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights.</p>\n<p>Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people&#x2019;s satisfaction with the institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land administration services and justice systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<p>The concepts below are based on the &#x201C;Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Forests and Fisheries in the Context of National Food Security&#x201D; (shorthand VGGT), which were endorsed by the United Nations World Committee on World Food Security in 2012 and therefore considered an internationally accepted standard. Other international frameworks using these concepts are the African Union Agenda on Land as laid out in the 2009 Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa and the 2014 Nairobi Action Plan on Large-Scale Land-Based Investments.</p>\n<p><strong>Tenure</strong>: How people, communities and others gain access to land and natural resources (including fisheries and forests) is defined and regulated by societies through systems of tenure. These tenure systems determine who can use which resources, for how long, and under what conditions. Tenure systems may be based on written policies and laws, as well as on unwritten customs and practices. No tenure right, including private ownership, is absolute. All tenure rights are limited by the rights of others and by the measures taken by states for public purposes (VGGT, 2012).</p>\n<p><strong>Tenure typology</strong>: A tenure typology is country specific and refers to categories of tenure rights, for example customary, leasehold, public and freehold. Rights can be held collectively, jointly or individually and may cover one or more elements of the bundle of rights (the right of possession, of control, of exclusion, of enjoyment and of disposition).</p>\n<p><strong>Land governance</strong>: Rules, processes and structures through which decisions are made regarding access to and the use (and transfer) of land, how those decisions are implemented and the way that conflicting interests in land are managed. States provide legal recognition for tenure rights through policies, law and land administration services, and define the categories of rights that are considered official.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> <em>Group rights</em> include shared or collective rights, and examples include the ejido in Mexico, indigenous territories in Honduras, perpetual DUAT for rural communities in Mozambique.

In many recent censuses, questions on household characteristics, including short modules on security of tenure, are collected. So far, 41 countries have carried out a census in which questions on land tenure were included. Options for expanding land-related questions in the upcoming agricultural census are being discussed together with FAO (custodians of 5.a.1).</p>\n<p><em>Household-level consumption/expenditure surveys:</em> To provide aggregate information on levels of consumption, prices and, often, estimates of GDP, many countries conduct this type of survey. As one of the key assets, this often includes questions on how residential land is accessed but rarely goes beyond this in terms of the type of documents held or the gender of rights holders. Elaborated housing modules are often included, and which already contain some questions on tenure status of the dwelling and documentation held. In consultation with the NSO, these modules will be fine-tuned to fully cover the essential land questions identified for 1.4.2.</p>\n<p><em>Multi-topic household surveys:</em> Building on the need to generate reliable poverty estimates and understand the factors that lead households to fall into poverty or escape from it in developing countries, these surveys include a roster of household members and, where agriculture is a main source of livelihood, a detailed agricultural module that in many cases obtains information on tenure status, ownership, and production at plot level. The essential questions for 1.4.2 as well as 5.a.1 have been included in the <em>Living Standard Measurement Surveys</em> approach, which includes individual surveys and puts much emphasis on measuring intra household dynamics through direct reporting.</p>\n<p><em>Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS):</em> Responding to a need for more frequent and reliable information on population and health, especially in developing countries, these types of surveys provide nationally representative data on a wide range of areas including fertility, family planning, maternal and child health, gender, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and nutrition. A standard questionnaire, regularly revised to incorporate newly emerging issues, is administrated at the household and individual level. It is a nationally representative survey. In a majority of DHS surveys, people eligible for individual interviews include women of reproductive age (15-49) and men age 15-49, 15-54, or 15-59.<strong> </strong>The individual questionnaires in the latest version (round 7) includes questions on whether respondents own land, if they have formal ownership documents, and if their name is included on these documents.</p>\n<p><em>Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS):</em> Surveys implemented by NSOs under the program developed by the United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF) to provide internationally comparable, statistically rigorous data on the situation of children and women. They cover topics such as health, education, child protection, and water and sanitation. The survey design follows closely that of DHS questions and modules. This facilitates cross-country comparisons of estimates obtained using DHS data with those obtained using MICS data. In addition to the household questionnaire, there are questionnaires for women of reproductive ages (15-49), men aged between 15 and 49 and children (aged 0-5 and aged 5-17). The household questionnaire includes questions on ownership of land that can be used for agriculture by any member of the household, and on the size of the agricultural land owned by the household members. Also, there are questions about ownership/rental of dwelling where the household lives.</p>\n<p>Discussions are ongoing with the teams in charge of DHS and MICS, specifically on expanding questions on land in their standardized and nationally representative surveys, in order to cover all data requirements for 1.4.2.</p>\n<p><em>Urban Inequity Surveys (UIS): </em>These specialized surveys were designed by UN-Habitat as household surveys to monitor and assess water and sanitation service coverage and other topics on urban inequities, including tenure.

Reporting on the information contained in these land records ((i) names of people holding rights, (ii) type of rights and (iii) location) is not difficult in principle if records are kept in a computerized format. Using household surveys, this land information can be cross-checked against survey information with respect to quality and coverage.

Many tenure problems also arise because of weak land governance, disputes due to land acquisition or large-scale land-based investments, and attempts to address tenure problems associated with dualisms to tenure regimes. Responsible governance of tenure of land is inextricably linked with access to and management of other natural resources, such as forests, water, fisheries and mineral resources. The governance of tenure is a crucial element in determining if and how people, communities and others acquire rights, and their associated obligations, to use and control land and natural resources. Legal recognition to group tenure or adopting a &#x2018;fit for purpose&#x2019; land administration and using these to recognize outer boundaries of land held under communal or customary arrangements have increasingly received government attention in the recent past. </p>\n<p>Increasing demand for pro-poor land reforms has created the need for a core set of land indicators that have national application and global comparability, and culminated in SDG 1.4.2<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup>. Regular reporting on indicator 1.4.2 will provide an impetus to improve the availability of data from surveys as well as regularity of reporting on land administration service delivery to people by registries and other line agencies. Indicator 1.4.2 thus measures gender disaggregated progress in tenure security.</p>\n<p>All forms of tenure should provide people with a degree of tenure security, with states protecting legitimate tenure rights, ensuring that people are not arbitrarily evicted and that their legitimate tenure rights are not otherwise extinguished or infringed. Perceptions of tenure security matter because they influence the way that land is used. Sources of perceived insecurity may include contestation from within households, families, communities or as a result of the actions of governments or private land claimants. Secure tenure rights for women require particular attention and could be affected by a number of factors, including intra-household power relations, community level inequalities, or different tenure regimes, and which can be cross tabulated against other factors of difference to ensure that women are no left behind. If measured at the individual level, the right to bequeath is another proxy of perception of tenure security. Women&#x2019;s ability to influence intergenerational land transfers is an important aspect of female empowerment (and one way in which this indicator links with indicator 5.a.1).</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Legally recognized documentation&#x201D; and &#x201C;perception of tenure security&#x201D; are two complementary parts of this indicator and which reflects several insights, namely (i) land is a key asset that is essential for poverty reduction, human rights and equality of opportunity including by gender; (ii) secure land tenure creates incentives for investment in land, allows land to be transferred, and creates the institutional precondition for use of land as collateral to access finance for economic activity; (iii) there is a need to complement formal measures of tenure security with perception-based measures.</p>\n<p>This indicator will inform policy and allow for the assessment of specific outcomes and practical priorities for further improvements of tenure security at the country level. Regular reporting on the two components of Indicator 1.4.2 will:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>provide incentives for governments to improve performance on progress with responsible land governance</li>\n  <li>inform governments and non-state actors to what extent countries&#x2019; legal and institutional frameworks recognize and support different land-tenure categories</li>\n  <li>provide information on implementation capacity to protect such rights in practice, as well as progress </li>\n  <li>identify the scope for additional action required at the country level as well as at a subnational level or for certain categories, geographic entities or ecosystems, and</li>\n  <li>provide for equity between men and women in land rights. </li>\n</ul><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-6\">5</sup><p> This need for data led to a collaboration between UN-Habitat, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the World Bank in 2012, facilitated by the Global Land Tool Network, to develop a set of core land indicators to measure tenure security globally and at country level; the process saw the start of the Global Land Indicators Initiative (GLII), a platform used by the global land community to underscore the need for tenure security through evidence-based policymaking through more and better data. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-6\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>In 2016, a total of 116 countries reported having electronic land information systems in place. Countries with paper-based systems will have more difficulties with reporting on administrative data and household surveys will be the main source of data for this indicator in these countries. The expansion of digitization of records and land data management is one way to facilitate the ease of reporting administrative data for this indicator. Coverage may, however, be geographically skewed, for example towards urban or specific rural regions where cadastral coverage is concentrated, and therefore sub-national dimensions should be properly considered and conveyed in narrative reporting by specific countries to accompany the headline data.</p>\n<p>In federal countries with decentralized land registry systems and no centralized reporting yet, data reporting systems for aggregation will be put in place. For countries where the land administration system does not yet collect information on gender, and gender disaggregation cannot be computed using other core data (social security numbers, ID etc), land agencies are encouraged to start expanding this by recording also the gender of owners/users of newly registered land.</p>\n<p>Most of the national household surveys&#x2019; target samples are sufficiently large to provide the statistical power for disaggregation by sex and tenure type at rural /urban and sub-national levels. Inferring the extent to which the adult population is tenure secure based on the existing web of surveys, will require the use of a standardized set of questions so that surveys can be combined. However, even nationally representative surveys tend to cover certain segments of the population (those living in agricultural areas, families in which there are women of reproductive age, official urban areas etc.). Even when all the existing surveys are aggregated, there may be pockets of the population that are not captured by the surveys and for which there is thus no data on tenure security. This may include families living in areas that are too far or costly to reach, like forest areas.</p>\n<p>Household surveys generally collect household-level data from proxy respondents. Family members who are not the head or the most knowledgeable person in their households are not interviewed, as is also noted in the methodological note for the IAEG-SDG Secretariat for Indicator 5.a.1. This approach is problematic for measuring tenure rights and security due to the introduction of non-random measurement errors<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-ref-7\">[6]</a></sup>. For instance, proxy reporting by one member of the household tends to incorrectly assign rights and misjudge and underestimate both women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s rights and use of land. Indicator 1.4.2 should therefore be based on self-reported rather than proxy data. If not all household members are surveyed, only those surveyed should be reported, estimating the global adult population based on the smaller sample enumerated. This lack of information affects only the numerators of the indicator; it has no bearing on the denominator which should always be the total adult population. In other words, the indicator reports and tracks the proportion of the population for which there is self-reported data stating that they are tenure secure. People for whom there is no information cannot be assumed to be tenure secure and therefore are not counted in the numerator. National statistics offices (NSOs) should report the data collected from household surveys as individual level data that corresponds to the respondent and is not extrapolated to the rest of his/her household. Any limitations in the representativeness of this data should be clearly noted in the country specific metadata submitted with the reporting, including who was included in the enumeration.</p>\n<p>Data will still be used for countries that do not yet have survey instruments in place that survey individuals, while capacity for expanding sampling and individual self-reporting by NSOs is expanded progressively through Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) and other type of surveys in coordination with FAO and UN-Women. Addressing this challenge will require combined efforts. Custodians of the land rights indicators1.4.2 and 5.a.1, and relevant stakeholders from the land sector, will work with custodians from other SDG indicators also require surveying of individuals, and in particular the NSOs, to identify effective approaches to start filling the void on self-reported data. NSOs need to be supported to collect data by interviewing individual adult household member. The custodians will leverage the work of the UN - Evidence and Data for Gender Equality <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/edge/\">EDGE project</a><u><sup><a href=\"#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-ref-8\">[7]</a></sup></u>, in particular, which is the most advanced in using and testing gender sensitive methodologies and approaches.

For instance, the study found that self-reported data increase both women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s reported ownership of agricultural land in Uganda. Such increase is greater for men (15 percentage points) than for women (10 percentage points), and is less pronounced when we consider documented ownership (+7 percentage points for men and +2 percentage points for women) (Kilic and Moylan, 20160. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-7\">&#x2191;</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-8\">7</sup><p> <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/edge/\">https://unstats.un.org/edge/</a> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-8\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 1.4.2 is composed of two parts: (A) measures the incidence of adults with legally recognized documentation over land among the total adult population; while (B) focuses on the incidence of adults who report having perceived secure rights to land among the adult population.

records. Ranging from less about 2% in Malawi and Nigeria to full coverage in Costa Rica, the Netherlands, and Korea, there is enormous variation in this part of the indicator across countries.</p>\n<p>Data on perceived tenure security, which is from survey data and self-reported for all except the European countries and Costa Rica. In the latter case, we used the share of the population who, according to the population census or household surveys, either report owning or renting land or their residence to represent the share of the population who enjoy legally recognized documentation and by implication whose tenure is legally secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Benin</strong>: Administrative data indicate that the population have received individual documents based on the Plan Foncier Rural, but also suggest that, with about 12% of documents registered in their name, women have not benefited to the extent that may be expected. </p>\n<p><strong>Costa Rica</strong>: Administrative records suggest that in Costa Rica, all land is covered with land records. But census data indicate that some 2.5% of the population still suffers from precarious tenure, highlighting that even in cases where administrative data are available, they need to be linked to population-based evidence to give a fuller picture. </p>\n<p><strong>Malawi</strong>: Although the Government is engaged in an ambitious effort to digitize available records that would provide a basis for better land administration and reporting, only information from household survey data is available. The survey data point to high levels of tenure insecurity that are mostly gender related.</p>\n<p><strong>Nigeria</strong>: As a federal country, several states in Nigeria have administrative data that are of sufficient quality for reporting for the pilot. Data suggest that insecurity is high and, in many cases, is caused by the state due to expropriation. </p>\n<p><strong>Rwanda</strong>: A representative survey is available and points towards high levels of tenure security. However, information on the gender distribution of legally recognized documentation can be more reliably obtained from administrative data that show that more than 86% of women have land registered in their name either individually or jointly and perception of tenure security is high. </p>\n<p><strong>The Netherlands</strong>: This case shows that administrative data can be gender-disaggregated, and that in an advanced economy the share of individuals accessing land through various forms of institutions is high.</p>\n<p>The Questionnaire Module with essential question for reporting on SDG 1.4.2</p>\n<p>The module with essential questions for reporting on 1.4.2 is discussed in detail below. The module is developed by the UN Habitat and the World Bank, together with FAO and UN Women, with inputs from other stakeholders through GDWGL and GLII, and supported by the Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) team. </p>\n<p>The results of the EDGE project and other recent evidence suggest that individual level data collection is preferred to potential proxy respondents (where feasible).</p>\n<p>Because of the scalability benefits of collecting data for both indicators simultaneously, the module is designed to provide the data required to compute indicators 1.4.2 as well as 5.a.1. Only the essential questions for indicator computation are included, however, the module may be expanded upon as needed by NSOs to address a wider range of land tenure issues relevant at the country level.</p>\n<p>The module example, appended to this note is designed as a household level questionnaire in which a full roster of parcels is collected at the household level and the module is then implemented for each parcel, where the respondent is the most knowledgeable household member for the given parcel.</p>\n<p>The module incorporates lessons learnt from methodological experiments1, as well as from implementation at national scale by the national Statistical Office of Malawi in its 2016/17 Integrated Household Survey (IHS4). The IHS4 interviewed 12,480 cross-sectional households across 780 EAs, and in parallel, revisited a national sub-sample of 2,516 households that had been previously interviewed in 2010 and 2013. As part of the IHS4 panel component, the survey administered up to 4 adult individual interviews per household. The modules asked separately questions regarding (i) reported ownership, (ii) economic ownership, (iii) documented ownership, and rights to (iv) sell, (v) bequeath, (vi) use as collateral, (vii) rent out, and (viii) make improvements/ invest.</p>\n<p>Indicator 1.4.2 considers two aspects of tenure security: documentation and perception. Only documentation that is official, and therefore provides legally protected tenure rights, is considered under indicator 1.4.2. That is combined with perception of tenure security, which is captured through the respondent-estimated probability of involuntary loss of land rights in the next five-year period and the reported right to bequeath.</p>\n<p>While the module has been carefully designed to be as universal as possible to maintain comparability of the computed indicator across time and space, certain questions, marked in the questionnaire, will require customization at the country level. Customization cannot be avoided in full due to the varying legal systems and land tenure arrangements across countries. Collection of metadata, including the identification of legally recognized documentation in the particular country context must take place prior to implementation of the module.</p>\n<p>The Questionnaire Module</p>\n<p>The questionnaire module assumes a survey that has households as the unit of enumeration and analysis, and where a household roster is used to identify household members and collected basic information on their demographics including age and gender. In this process, each household member is assigned a unique identifier (HHID). In the Annex, the questions are color-coded to identify those required for indicator 1.4.2 only, for indicator 5.a.1 only, for both indicators, and those included for disaggregation or other analytical purposes. In what follows, practical issues for implementation are discussed, and explanatory notes on each individual question presented.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability &amp; Up-Take</strong></p>\n<p>While it is to be expected that the module will be usually implemented in conjunction with a larger survey operation, nothing prevents users to implement it independently. Implementing the module in the context of multi-topic surveys will increase its analytical value as, beyond generating an indicator for the SDG monitoring process, countries would be in a position to explore how land tenure issues relate to other development outcomes, including other SDG goals. The custodians foresee implementing the module as part of Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) surveys and the Urban Inequality Survey (UIS), and will be discussed with the USAID-funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme, and UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). Any nationally representative sample survey can of course become a vehicle for implementing the module. The custodians envisage working with National Statistical Offices to engage in dissemination and capacity development, as integrating the module in national statistical programs is the only viable way to ensure sustainability of the data collection process and ownership of the results by countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Method</strong></p>\n<p>The questionnaire module has been designed for paper assisted personal interviewing (PAPI) implementation to have the widest reach. However, an electronic version of the questionnaire will be created by the custodians for use in computer assisted personal interviewing. The application will be created using the World Bank&#x2019;s open access CAPI platform, Survey Solutions (solutions.worldbank. org), and will be made publicly available. The CAPI application can be customized from the base module as necessary. Implementation of the module via CAPI is recommended, as this can minimize data entry errors, allow for more immediate data review and analysis, and enable quick use of photo aids (which can improve data quality).</p>\n<p><strong>Before Going to the Field: Collecting Metadata</strong></p>\n<p>In this context, metadata refers to the classification of land documentation into legally recognized and unrecognized types as defined for indicator 1.4.2. The metadata will vary by country and will therefore, need to be released along with the computation of the indicator for transparency, and update in the case of changes in the regulatory frameworks. The metadata will identify which types of documentation are legally recognized, and therefore, what constitutes secure tenure. Questions on unrecognized and/or informal documentation can be asked separately, but is not considered in the computation of Indicator 1.4.2.</p>\n<p><strong>Question-by-Question Guidance</strong></p>\n<p>The implementation of the questionnaire included in the Annex is fairly intuitive, yet it is recommended that prior to its implementation, adequate training is provided and an enumerator manual is produced to guide data collection, including with images of the range of tenure related documentation in use by land holders. Detailed explanatory notes on each question are found below, which can be used to develop such manuals. Where customization is necessary, this is indicated. Annex I also indicates skip patterns (indicated by the arrow sign &#x2018;&gt;&gt;&#x2019;).</p>\n<p><strong>Guidance for sample questionnaire annex 1 (household survey with parcel roster)</strong></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>RESPONDENT ID:</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The respondent ID is the ID of the person responding for the respective parcel, recorded from the household roster.
