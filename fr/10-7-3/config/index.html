As such, MMP and therefore the 10.7.3 dataset are constructed by IOM staff at the Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC) and rely on other data providers &#x2013; including local authorities, NGOs, surveys with survivors, and other sources &#x2013; which are outlined in <a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a>.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>International Organization for Migration (IOM)</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>IOM began documenting deaths during migration in 2014 under the Missing Migrants Project. SDG indicator 10.7.3 was adopted in March 2020 as one measure of &#x2018;safe&#x2019; migration called for in Target 10.7.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Missing Migrants Project (MMP) data bears witness to the ongoing global crisis of deaths during migration and is the only global database on this topic. It is hoped that by counting and accounting for these deaths, almost all of which are linked to irregular migration, policymakers, academics, and the general public will be better informed about the risks linked to unsafe migration. While data by itself might not bring about change, it can provide the necessary evidence to prompt action. However, it is likely that the data currently available is a vast undercount of the true number of lives lost during migration.</p>\n<p>There are few official sources of data on deaths during migration, and none at a national level. Thus, MMP data are best understood as a minimum estimate of the true number of deaths during migration worldwide. Data are collected from a variety of sources outlined in <a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a>. In the disaggregated public database available from the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int\">MMP website</a>, there are several variables which indicate the information source and quality of each incident involving death(s) during migration.</p>\n<p>An important consideration for SDG 10.7.3 data is that these information sources change over time. These changes are linked to the varying capacity of the MMP team to gather these data, but also to narratives of migration &#x2018;crises&#x2019; that shape public attention and therefore data availability from media and non-governmental sources. This politicization of irregular migration profoundly affect access to relevant information and thus data coverage, quality and comparability. With this in mind, SDG 10.7.3 data are best understood as indicative of the global nature of migrant fatalities and should be used to identify trends over time with the adequate caveats.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on deaths during migration are fragmented, incomplete and scattered among many different sources. The Missing Migrants Project (MMP) database provides a global overview of data on migrant fatalities, but it is primarily dependent on secondary sources of information. The reliability and completeness of data vary greatly from region to region, from country to country and over time. In addition to undercounting the absolute number of deaths which occur during migration, MMP data also lack identifying information in many cases (incl. age, gender, country of origin).</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a> illustrates the wide variety of sources used in the MMP database and gives some insight into the various advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Missing Migrants Project (MMP) is an incident-based database, meaning that each entry in the database represents a single occurrence in which an individual or group of individuals die during migration or at international borders in one particular place and time.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> This approach is used instead of a body/human remains-based database due to the fact that many migrant bodies are never recovered, particularly in overseas routes such as the Mediterranean Sea, or remote terrains such as the Sahara Desert. Indicator 10.7.3 does not include statistical estimates of the true number of lives lost given the extreme variance in completeness (coverage and quality) of data but MMP is currently developing an estimation methodology.</p>\n<p>The MMP database provides a global overview of data on migrant fatalities, but it is primarily dependent on secondary sources of information. Information is gathered from diverse sources such as official records &#x2013; including from coast guards and medical examiners &#x2013; and other sources such as media reports, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and surveys and interviews of migrants. When a record is added to the MMP database, often it is a result of bringing together several different data sources. For example, a death may be reported first by the media, and subsequently there may be a government statement confirming what happened, and then migrant families and community members may offer information on the likely identity of the person who died. The reliability and completeness of data vary greatly from region to region, from country to country and over time. <a href=\"#_Table_1:_Missing\">Table 1</a> gives an overview of the data sources used and their strengths and limitations.

In practice, this means that whenever possible each incident is based on multiple independent sources of information. Whenever possible, and especially for incidents reported in the media, Missing Migrants Project (MMP) verifies each incident through consultation with local IOM staff and/or other relevant stakeholders. In mass casualty events where large numbers of people die and no remains are recovered (i.e. in shipwrecks) MMP data reflect the lowest estimated number of dead and missing persons. Several variables in the disaggregated dataset available from the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int\">MMP website</a> (Information source, Source Quality) reflect the level to which each incident could be validated.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>As the Missing Migrants Project (MMP) database is incident-based and includes only verified deaths, no adjustments are made for Indicator 10.7.3.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p>As Missing Migrants Project (MMP) data is incident-based and reflects only deaths during migration, which can be verified, data are highly incomplete.

The location (region, route, etc.) categorizations used in the Missing Migrants Project (MMP) database are described <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/regional-classification\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>World aggregates differ from the sum of regional totals because incidents in international bodies of water are not classified within any region but are included in the world total, providing a more accurate representation of deaths and disappearances worldwide.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>IOM guidance for data collection on 10.7.3 is available in <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl601/files/publication/file/MMP%2520data%2520collection%2520guidelines_EN.pdf\">English</a>, <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl601/files/publication/file/MMP_data_collection_guidelines-ESP.pdf\">Spanish</a>, and <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl601/files/publication/file/MMP%2520Data%2520collection%2520guidelines_FR.pdf\">French</a>. on the Missing Migrants Project (MMP) <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">website</a>.</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Missing Migrants Project (MMP) data are managed by a team of experts based at IOM&#x2019;s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre. Data cleaning is undertaken at least once annually. Incidents recorded in the MMP database are generally quite timely; however, given the dearth of official information on deaths during migration the database as a whole is both highly incomplete and individual records often have low accuracy, especially in terms of the identities of those who die during migration.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>As the data contained in the Missing Migrants Project (MMP) dataset comes from a wide variety of sources, all data are verified by a team at IOM&#x2019;s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre to ensure that</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the incident reported meets MMP&#x2019;s definition of a death during migration</li>\n  <li>the information contained in the report is accurate and complete</li>\n  <li>all new incidents reported are checked against existing records to reduce the likelihood of double counting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter process usually consists of searching for separate reports on the same incident which contain similar information, including contacting the relevant authorities for confirmation where possible. The &#x2018;Source quality&#x2019; variable indicates the reliability of the information reported (see <a href=\"#_Table_2:_Variables\">Table 2</a> for details).</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on deaths during migration remains highly incomplete to the point that statistical assessment is nearly impossible. For this reason, the fully disaggregated Missing Migrants Project (MMP) database includes a &#x2018;source quality&#x2019; indicator that indicates the type of information source for each incident involving a migrant death recorded. Little information is typically known about the overall population of irregular migrants in many countries, let alone of those on the move irregularly or the risks to life that they face on their journeys.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>The Missing Migrants Project (MMP) is a global project, and as such collects data in all regions of the world. However, as mentioned throughout this document, MMP data is only as robust as the data sources available, meaning that for remote geographies less data tends to be available. Generally, MMP&#x2019;s coverage is strongest in the Mediterranean and the US-Mexico border, whereas for the rest of the world data coverage is believed to be poor. However, coverage should not be equated with data quality, as for example in the case of the Mediterranean Sea, many remains are lost and consequently the data on the identities (age, gender, country of origin, name) of the decedents is highly incomplete.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>2014-present (ongoing data collection)</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Data on SDG 10.7.3 is aggregated by country and year per the SDG reporting standards. However, far more disaggregated data are available in the public database available on the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">MMP website</a>, with exceptions following UN and IOM data protection principles. <a href=\"#_Table_2:_Variables\">Table 2</a>, below, presents the list of variables that constitute the MMP database. While ideally all incidents recorded would include entries for each of these variables &#x2013; as these inform both the situation in which a death occurred and the profiles of those who died &#x2013; the lack of official data on deaths during migration, as described above, mean that this is not always possible. The minimum information necessary to record an incident in the MMP database is the date of the incident, the number of dead and/or the number of missing, and the location of death. If the information for other variables is unavailable, the cell is left blank or &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; is recorded, as indicated in the table below.</p>\n<h5>Table 2: Variables recorded in IOM&#x2019;s Missing Migrants Project database</h5>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Variable Name</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Description</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incident ID</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>An automatically generated number used to identify each unique entry in the dataset.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Region of incident</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>The region in which an incident took place.
