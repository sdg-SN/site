This definition is based on definitions of bribery of national public officials, bribery of foreign public officials and official of international organisations and bribery in the private sector that are contained in the United Nations Convention against Corruption (articles 15, 16, and 21).</p>\n<p>While the concept of bribery is broader, as it includes also actions such as promising or offering, and it covers both public and private sector, this indicator focuses on specific forms of bribery that are more measurable (the giving and/or requesting of bribes) and it limits the scope to the public sector.</p>\n<p>The concept of undue advantage is operationalized by reference to giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special treatment.</p>\n<p>This indicator captures the often called &#x2018;administrative bribery&#x2019;, which is often intended as the type of bribery affecting citizens in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil servants.</p>\n<p>For this indicator, public official refers to persons holding a legislative, executive, administrative or judicial office.

However, direct bribery experiences of the respondent can include instances where the giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service is done through someone else (e.g. middlemen). Experience of bribery is collected through a series of questions on concrete contacts and experiences of bribery with a list of public official and civil servants.</p>\n<p>The denominator refers only to those persons that had at least one direct interaction with a public official/civil servant as they form the population group at risk of experiencing bribery.</p>\n<p>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) collects data on the prevalence of bribery through its annual data collection: the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 140 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>At international level, data are collected by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) through the annual UN-CTS data collection.

For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to the permanent mission in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once consolidated, data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and validity.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>III-IV quarter year n</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>II quarter year n+1 (data for year n-1).

UNODC partners with regional organizations in the collection and dissemination of data, respectively with Eurostat in Europe and with the Organisation of American States in the Americas. </p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) &#x2013; as custodian of the UN standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, UNODC assists Member States in reforming their criminal justice systems in order to be effective, fair and humane for the entire population. UNODC develops technical tools to assist Member States in implementing the UN standards and norms and supports Member States through the provision of technical assistance in crime prevention and criminal justice reform. It does so through several Global programmes and through the UNODC field office network.</p>\n<p>UNODC is responsible for carrying out the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), which was introduced through the General Assembly Resolution <a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)\">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972. The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984, further requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Corruption is an antonym of equal accessibility to public services and of correct functioning of the economy; as such, it has a negative impact on fair distribution of resources and development opportunities. Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when administrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule of law, democratic processes and justice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective metric of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against corruption</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Bribery prevalence in the SDG indicator framework is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official money, a gift or counter favour) to a public official, <u>or were asked for a bribe by these public officials</u>, in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period.</p>\n<p>In this formulation, the share of the population in contact with public officials who was asked to pay a bribe (but did not give it) is to beincluded in the numerator of the indicator. However, several historical and on-going survey programmes implemented at the national and international level do not include experiences of bribery refusal in the formulation and prevalence computation. It is expected that data according to the preferred definition (which includes bribery refusal) will become increasingly available at national and global level, as standardised question wording and indicator computation are applied.</p>\n<p>On a more general level, it should be noted that this indicator provides information on the experiences of bribery occurring during interactions between citizens and the public sector, while it does not cover other forms of corruption, such as &#xB4;grand corruption&#xB4;, trading in influence, or abuse of power.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of persons who paid at least one bribe to a public official (or were asked for a bribe) in the last 12 months, over the total number of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period, multiplied by 100.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>B</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>i</mi>\n    <mi>b</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>r</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>v</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>l</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>c</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>B</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>Where <em>B</em> refers to the number of people who paid a bribe to or were asked for a bribe by public official in the last 12 months, and <em>C </em>refers to the total number of people who had contact with public officials in the last 12 months.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Following the submission of the CTS questionnaire, UNODC checks the submitted data for consistency and coherence with other data sources. For survey-based indicators, metadata are assessed in relation to the representativeness and coverage of the survey as well as alignment of question wording and answer options with international standards. Member States which are also part of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association, or candidate or potential candidate to the European Union are sending their response to the UN-CTS to Eurostat for validation.
