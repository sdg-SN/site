Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [&#x2026;]&#x201D;. See here for the full definition: <a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104\">https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104</a> </p>\n<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation, or any other formal or informal union.</p>\n<p>The <u>different forms of violence</u> included in the indicator are defined as follows: </p>\n<p>1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting, hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. </p>\n<p>2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation, or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts (intercourse) without consent (rape or attempted rape), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally defined in surveys as being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to do something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.</p>\n<p>3. Psychological violence consists of any act that induces fear or emotional distress. It includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission). These are also considered acts of psychological abuse, although usually measured separately. . </p>\n<p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual, and psychological violence against women, see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014), and the <em>International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</em> ICCS (UNODC, 2015), and <em>Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018.

The agency provides census technical support to more than 125 countries, through strong partnerships with governments, UN country teams, the US Census Bureau, and the population and data sectors worldwide. Census data provide the denominators for computation of many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a basis for weights when calculating regional and global aggregates of various indicators, including SDGs. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence that women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions/relationships. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and discrimination.</p>\n<p>Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk and explore the barriers to seeking help to ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies and developing effective responses and prevention programs. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximize the effectiveness of interventions (especially in resource-constrained settings).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p><u>Comparability:</u></p>\n<p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, or used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and recall periods (e.g., different definitions of &#x201C;lifetime&#x201D;). Many survey measures and/or reports lack disaggregation by different forms of intimate partner violence (physical, sexual, psychological). There are often differences in survey question formulations and/or denominators e.g. all women [various age ranges], or only ever-married/partnered or currently married/partnered women). There is also heterogeneity in age groups sampled and reported on. The quality of interviewer training also likely varies, although this is difficult to quantify. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented and the social/cultural context, and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p>\n<p>Given the wide variations in methodologies, measurement, and quality across studies from different countries, statistically adjusted estimates are currently needed to ensure comparability across countries and regions. However, generating estimates is an interim solution and individual countries need to collect robust, internationally comparable, high-quality data that reflect the relevant socio-economic, political and cultural risk, and protective factors associated with the prevalence of violence against women (VAW) to inform appropriate policy responses and programmatic decision-making. As more countries adopt international recommendations and guidelines, including the key elements described in this document, the need for adjustments for estimates for global monitoring will be greatly reduced.</p>\n<p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>\n<p>Since 2000, only about 78 countries have conducted more than one survey on VAW. Obtaining data on VAW is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the main source of data for low- and lower-middle Income Countries (LMICs), are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available for regular surveys. At the same time prevalence is unlikely to change from year to year so, depending on resources, every 3-5 years is recommended.</p>\n<p><u>Feasibility:</u></p>\n<p>This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate partner violence (IPV): physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global consensus on how physical and sexual IPV are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence&#x2014;is conceptualized differently across cultures and in different contexts. This indicator therefore currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting psychological IPV. This will enable reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future. </p>\n<p>Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above have been subjected to. Most data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports on both violence ever-partnered women 15-49 years of age and 15 years and older have been subjected to. Given the existing limited data availability on violence against women aged 50 years and older, efforts are underway by the custodian agencies to improve the measurement and encourage increased availability of data for women of this age group. This will enable a better estimation of the extent of this problem and understanding the experiences of partner violence for women over 50. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group. Countries are encouraged to compute prevalence data for each form of violence as detailed below to assist comparability at the regional and global levels: </p>\n<p><u>1. Physical intimate partner violence: </u></p>\n<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) subjected to any act of physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 .</p>\n<p><u>2.

Many women who are subjected to abuse do not report or seek help for the violence and those who do, tend to be the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data are not recommended as a data source for this indicator. </p>\n<p>For more information on recommended practices in the production of VAW statistics, see <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).

Studies included within this database were identified through a comprehensive systematic review of published global prevalence data, metadata repositories of national statistics offices and through the country consultation process as explained below. </p>\n<p>Informed by international guidelines on the survey measurement of violence against women, including the <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014) only population-based studies, representative at national or subnational level that used the &#x2018;gold standard&#x2019; act-specific measures of IPV were eligible for inclusion. This criterion aimed to minimise the under-estimation of the prevalence of IPV that is associated with the use of broader non-acts-based measures. Data extractions were conducted by two data analysts independently and underwent additional quality control and rigorous consistency checks by a third reviewer.</p>\n<p>The United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence Against Women Estimation and Data (VAW-IAWGED) guided the process of developing the estimates and reviewed the Technical Note for the country consultation and published estimates&#x2019; report. The independent external Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the VAW-IAWGED provided expert advice and input throughout the process of developing the methodology and the estimates.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, and in line with WHO&#x2019;s quality standards for data production and publication a formal country consultation process was conducted with 194 Member States and one territory (occupied Palestinian territory). The purpose this consultation process was to (i) to ensure that countries had the opportunity to review their national modelled intimate partner violence estimates and the data sources (surveys/studies) used in the production of these estimates; (ii) to ensure the inclusion of any additional surveys/studies that met these inclusion criteria but not been previously identified; and (iii) to familiarize countries with the statistical modelling approach used to derive the global, regional and national estimates.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2000, 161 countries have conducted violence against women (VAW) national or subnational prevalence surveys or have included a module on VAW in a DHS or other national household surveys. However, not all these data are comparable and in many cases, they are not collected on a regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>Some countries (~77) have data on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence for two or more time points. Global time series with comparable data are not yet available. </p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to form of violence and age, income/wealth, education, ethnicity (including indigenous status), disability status, marital/partnership status, relationship with the perpetrator (i.e., current/former partner), geographic location, migration status, and frequency of violence are suggested as desired variables for disaggregation for this indicator. Though disaggregated data by these variables is not yet feasible to report on at regional and global levels, countries are encouraged to report these levels of disaggregation in their national reports; and&#x2014;whenever possible&#x2014;include these data for the age group 15 to 49.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>All available survey data sources that are representative at the national and subnational level, are used to generate the prevalence estimates. The data are from published survey reports and/or data and datasets provided by countries. In cases where only data disaggregated by violence type were presented in the report, microdata was used to calculate the aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV). As there is variability in the measurement across surveys and countries, relevant covariate adjustments were made to enhance comparability. These include adjustments for case definitions (e.g. severity), type of violence (i.e. physical IPV only or sexual IPV only), population surveyed (e.g. currently married women only or all women), reference partners (e.g. current/most recent partners), and geographical strata (rural or urban), aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual IPV where only one of the two forms were available.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://srhr.org/vaw-data\">https://srhr.org/vaw-data</a> </p>\n<p>http://evaw-global-database.unwomen.org/en</p>\n<p>data.unicef.org </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/default.html\">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/default.html</a> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>1.
