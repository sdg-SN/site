However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that govern customary land among and within countries and their unwritten nature, create a significant challenge for assessing whether the proxies are present in these systems. Therefore, the customary dimension will only be considered in the case it has been incorporated the legal system. </p>\n<p>Finally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are two critical but different dimensions of women&#x2019;s land rights. Land ownership refers to the legally recognized right to acquire, use and transfer land property, while control over land is associated with the ability to make decisions over land.</p>\n<p>Key definitions are the following:</p>\n<p><em>Land</em></p>\n<p>Land is defined as all immovable property &#x2013; for instance the house, the land upon which a house is built and land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms &#x2018;immovable property&#x2019; or &#x2018;real property&#x2019; when referring to land.</p>\n<p><em>Land ownership</em></p>\n<p>Land ownership is a legally recognized right to acquire, use and transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term &#x201C;land ownership&#x201D; refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system &#x2013; for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are transferrable and are granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years).</p>\n<p><em>Control over land</em></p>\n<p>Control over land is the ability to make decisions over land. It may include rights to make decisions about how the land should be used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops. </p>\n<p><em>Customary land tenure</em></p>\n<p>Customary land tenure is defined as the bodies of rules and institutions governing the way land and natural resources are held, managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems.</p>\n<p><em>Customary legal systems</em></p>\n<p>Customary legal systems are systems that exist at the local or community level, that have not been set up by the state, and that derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or local group. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national law. </p>\n<p><em>Legal and policy framework</em></p>\n<p>The legal and policy framework comprises a set of publicly available legal and policy instruments governing land and family matters in force when conducting the assessment, including the Constitution, primary - and secondary legislation and policies. It includes customary legal systems where they have been recognized by statutory law.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Personal laws </em></p>\n<p>Personal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms applying to a group of people sharing a common religious faith about personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, marriage, and inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with &#x2018;religious laws&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><em>Primary legislation </em></p>\n<p>Primary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes that have been formally adopted at the national level following the official parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems); (ii) other acts at the national level with the force of law, such as decree-laws and legislative decrees and otherwise (in parliamentary systems); (iii) other legal instruments that have been formally endorsed by a law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential and royal decrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making power lies in an additional institution to the parliament). In all cases, primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For this assessment primary legislation includes the Constitution. </p>\n<p><em>Secondary legislation</em></p>\n<p>Secondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated or subordinate legal instruments that have the force of law, are binding, and shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually passed by the executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations, directions, circulars, orders, and implementing decrees.</p>\n<p><em>Joint registration</em></p>\n<p>Joint registration is where the names of both spouses or both partners in an unmarried couple, are entered into the land registry as the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint registration signifies a form of shared tenure over the land &#x2013; usually either a joint tenancy/occupancy or a tenancy in common). In legal systems which include a framework for land titling, joint registration is commonly referred to as joint titling. </p>\n<p><em>Unmarried couples</em></p>\n<p>Unmarried couples are defined as couples who live together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who are not married following the marriage law of the country. It refers to couples who were married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages are not recognized or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law. It may also refer to relationships that are recognized by the state but that are not considered a marriage &#x2013; for instance a civil partnership and a de facto relationship that is registered with the state. The term &#x2018;unmarried couples&#x2019; is often used interchangeably with &#x2018;de facto unions&#x2019;, &#x2018;consensual unions&#x2019; or &#x2018;irregular unions&#x2019;. The members of an unmarried couple are referred to as &#x2018;partners&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><em>Land transactions</em></p>\n<p>Land transactions for the methodology are major land transactions, specifically the sale and encumbrance (mortgage) of land. </p>\n<p><em>Inheritance</em></p>\n<p>Inheritance is defined as property passing at the owner&apos;s death to the heir or those entitled to succeed.</p>\n<p><em>Deceased&#x2019;s estate</em></p>\n<p>The deceased&#x2019;s estate encompasses the legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind (not only land) which the deceased spouse or partner enjoyed at the time of death, less any liabilities. Depending on the legal system, marital property may be excluded fully from the calculation of deceased&#x2019;s estate, or the deceased&#x2019;s 50% share in the marital property will be included. </p>\n<p><em>Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters</em></p>\n<p>Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters require the law on intestate inheritance to either be gender-neutral or provide for both an equal rank and equal shares in the inheritance for brothers and sisters (or daughters and sons).</p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>The proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women&#x2019;s equal rights to land ownership and/or control is the unit for measuring progress at the global and/or regional level. </p>\n<p>At the national level, it &#x2018;measures&#x2019; the extent to which the legal and policy framework protects women&#x2019;s land rights against the 6 proxies defined for monitoring SDG indicator 5.a.2.

In this sense, if the proxies are present in these types of instruments they constitute an important step towards a more gender sensitive legal framework.</p>\n<p>The data are extracted directly from the laws in force when the assessment is carried out. Data collection/provision entails the assessment of the relevant laws to determine if the six proxies are present or not in the legal framework.

It is a key input for agricultural production; it can facilitate access to financial and extension services or to join producer organisations. Moreover, it can generate income directly if rented or sold. It also acknowledges that women&#x2019;s ownership of and/or control of land is critical for poverty reduction, food security, inclusiveness and overall sustainable development objectives. Finally, gender equality in land ownership and control is a human right. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees equality between women and men, and prohibits discrimination based on sex in Article 2. Article 26 of the ICCPR enshrines equality before the law and can be applied to defend women&#x2019;s right to non-discrimination and equality, including economic and social rights. Further, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), emphasizes that discrimination against women &#x201C;violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity&quot;.</p>\n<p>The following paragraphs describe the scope and rationale of the proxies, as well as their specific content. </p>\n<p>For guidance on the meaning of the terms used in the proxies please refer to the terminology in section 2.a &#x201C;Definitions and concepts&#x201D; of this document. For detailed information on the conditions determining whether the proxy exists in the legal framework please refer to the methodological guidelines &#x201C;Realizing women&#x2019;s rights to land in the law. A Guide for reporting on SDG Indicator 5.a.2&#x201D;.</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy A:</strong> Is the joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives?</p>\n<p>Without the inclusion of their names on the land title, deed or certificate, women&#x2019;s property rights remain insecure, especially in the context of land registration programs and property acquired by the spouses during the marriage. This is particularly the case for married women who separate, divorce, are abandoned, or become widows.</p>\n<p>The proxy therefore assesses whether the legal and policy framework includes provisions requiring joint registration of land or encouraging joint registration through economic incentives for both married and unmarried couples. For the proxy to be present it is sufficient that joint registration is provided at least for married couples.</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy B:</strong> Does the legal and policy framework require spousal consent for land transactions?</p>\n<p>Major land transactions, such as the sale, mortgage or lease of family land or the family home, can directly affect women&#x2019;s land rights if they do not participate in the decisions. Therefore, spousal or partner consent requirements for such transaction strengthen women&#x2019;s control rights over land by protecting them against unilateral actions taken by their husband or, in the case of unmarried couples, partner. Provisions that support equality in marriage relations and that provide for joint administration of matrimonial property including land, directly contribute to gender equality in the control over land. </p>\n<p>The proxy examines whether national laws provide for mandatory spouse or partner consent for land transactions. As with proxy A, the assessment covers both married and unmarried couples. Yet, for proxy B to be present it is sufficient that spousal consent is provided at least for married couples.</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy C:</strong> Does the legal and policy framework support women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights?</p>\n<p>Inheritance is one of the main channels through which women acquire property and secure independent land rights. However, the persistence of discriminatory cultural and legal norms often denies women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; equal inheritance rights and hinders women&#x2019;s opportunity to acquire property on an equal footing to men. Personal laws and customary laws, in particular, often deny women&#x2019;s right to inherit or to inherit in equal shares. However, many post-colonial governments have incorporated these rules in the formal legal architecture. In some cases, daughters may only be entitled to inherit in the absence of a traceable male relative. </p>\n<p>Proxy C examines the extent to which national laws on intestate inheritance establish equal inheritance rights for surviving children and the surviving spouse(s) regardless of sex.</p>\n<p>This proxy aims to identify if the legal and policy framework of a country provides that: </p>\n<p>1. Sons and daughters have equal inheritance rights and equal shares; and</p>\n<p>2. Male and female surviving spouse and/or partner are entitled to an equal right of the deceased spouse&#x2019;s estate and/or to a lifetime user right to the family home.</p>\n<p>The law must prescribe both equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters and for the surviving spouse and/or partner for Proxy to be present.</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy D:</strong> Does the legal and policy framework provide for the allocation of financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land?</p>\n<p>Legal reforms to support gender equality in land ownership and/or control and access to other productive resources have not always translated into practice. The poor implementation of land and agriculture related policies and laws geared towards enhancing gender equality, is partially due to the lack or insufficiency of financial resources. </p>\n<p>For this reason, this proxy identifies any legal provision that commits the government to allocate financial resources to increase women&#x2019;s ownership and control over land or access to productive resources, including land. Such provisions are widely regarded as innovative measures to support women&#x2019;s land rights and have been consistently endorsed by the CEDAW Committee in its deliberations and comments on state parties&#x2019; reports under the treaty. For this proxy to be present, the fund must be anchored into a national law that explicitly mentions the purpose of improving women&#x2019;s land rights.</p>\n<p>Since Proxy D amounts to a &#x201C;special measure&#x201D;, as per Art. 4 of CEDAW, countries that do not include this measure in their legal framework, may provide official statistical data that show, nationally, at least 40 percent of those who own or have secure rights to land <strong>are women</strong> to satisfy the proxy.</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy E</strong>: In legal systems that recognize customary land tenure, does the legal and policy framework explicitly protect the land rights of women?</p>\n<p>Many countries have incorporated customary land tenure rights into the formal legal system, in effect &#x2018;formalizing&#x2019; them. The legal recognition of customary land tenure however may reinforce discriminatory practices where there is no explicit protection for women&#x2019;s customary land rights. Further, the use of gender-neutral provisions in the context of formalization of customary land tenure has in practice been associated with a lack of protection of women&#x2019;s rights. To avoid such outcomes explicit provisions protecting the land rights of women should accompany legal provisions recognizing customary land rights. </p>\n<p>Proxy E assesses whether the Constitution and/or any land related law that recognizes customary land tenure, explicitly protect s women&#x2019;s land rights. </p>\n<p>It is important to note that for those countries where customary law has not been incorporated into the legal framework, Proxy E is not applicable and will not be assessed in the computation. As noted above, the customary dimension of this indicator will only be considered when it has been legally recognized. </p>\n<p><strong>Proxy F:</strong> Does the legal and policy framework mandate women&#x2019;s participation in land management and administration institutions?</p>\n<p>Land related institutions are responsible for governing the land tenure systems and are in charge of land administration and management. Women are often excluded from participating in the day-to-day processes of land governance at all levels, and therefore have limited capacity to influence decision-making. A lack of women&#x2019;s representation in land governance tends to lead to biased outcomes in land recording and registration processes and the hindering of women&#x2019;s land claims, for instance by overlooking women&#x2019;s rights on common lands. </p>\n<p>Proxy F aims to identify provisions within the legal framework requiring mandatory participation of women (quotas) in land related management and administration institutions.</p>\n<p>Since Proxy F amounts to a &#x201C;special measure&#x201D;, as per Art. 4 of CEDAW, countries that do not include this measure in their legal and policy framework, yet provide official statistical data that show, nationally, at least 40 percent of those who own or have secure rights to land are women, will equally satisfy the proxy.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Customary law </p>\n<p>Since customary law is not a homogenous system of law, assessing whether it establishes equal rights to land ownership and/or control for women and men is very challenging. Therefore, the methodology determines that customary law will only be considered to the extent that it has been recognized in the legal framework. However, this also means that reporting data does not cover the legal systems where customary law has not been formalized but continues to govern family and land matters, possibly constituting a major factor of discrimination against women. Further, given that customary law does not exist in all countries, it is not universally applicable. The methodology has addressed this issue by creating a dual system of computation of the results, which is explained below in section 4. </p>\n<p>Geographical scope. </p>\n<p>The data collected for the SDG indicator 5.a.2 is collected at the national level to ensure that it adequately represents the national legal system. This means that the 5.a.2 assessment to determine the existence of the proxies should focus on legal and policy instruments that have nationwide authority. In countries where law-making power for land or gender matters does not reside with the central authority (or is shared between the national government and a sub-national government), the assessment may require analysing laws at state, provincial or county level. However, any research at sub-national level can only be undertaken <em>after </em>mapping and analysing the relevant provisions in the overarching legal framework at constitutional and federal level for a focused and efficient data collection process. </p>\n<p>In case the assessment requires data collection and data analysis at the sub-national level, a sample of the states, provinces or counties will be established, including the most populous states up until reaching 50 percent of the total country&#x2019;s population. Since the results must have nationwide authority, the proxy should be located in the laws of each state, province or county that is part of the sample. If it is not the case, the proxy is not present.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The qualitative and legal nature of this indicator required the development of a nuanced and articulated methodology that could be feasible, universally relevant and meaningful. </p>\n<p>The computation of results under Indicator 5.a.2 involves two steps: (1) classification of the country according to the number of proxies located <strong>in primary or primary and secondary legislation</strong> and (2) consolidation of all country results for global reporting.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Classification categories of country </h2>\n<p>The country will be classified according to the total number of proxies found in <u>primary legislation</u> or <u>primary and secondary legislation</u>.

The same applies to the global aggregation which will be calculated based on the unweighted regional average/mean score, once 50% of the regions have been classified in a particular band. </p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p> The Methodology used by countries for the compilation of the data at the national level (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/i8785en/I8785EN.pdf\">https://www.fao.org/3/i8785en/I8785EN.pdf</a>) and the </p>\n<p> questionnaires provided to countries include guidance, definitions and instructions.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Technical support provided by FAO to the representatives and legal experts from the designated responsible institutions</li>\n  <li>E-learning available in the FAO learning academy <a href=\"https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364\">https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=364</a></li>\n</ul>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>This is a qualitative, legal indicator. Upon submission of the reporting questionnaire by the focal point in the responsible institution, FAO performs a quality assessment based on the methodology. This ensures that the reporting is carried out consistently across all reporting countries. During this quality review, FAO may provide methodological clarifications to ensure conformity with the methodological guidelines.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>The assessment of laws is initially carried out by national counterparts, and legal practitioners in the relevant areas of law (land, land registration, land programmes, matrimonial property, inheritance, quota&#x2019;s ensuring women&#x2019;s participation in land administration and management bodies, for all types of land -including agrarian, customary, housing-). The data is checked and verified by the FAO. The data is then sent to the designated focal points/country counterparts to review and validate. Please refer to section 3 above on Data source type and data collection method for more details. </p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>See section 4.d. on validation. The methodological guidelines are used to set criteria that are applied equally to all countries for the purposes of ensuring comparability across countries and regions.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable</p>\n<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable</p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/i8785en/I8785EN.pdf\">https://www.fao.org/3/i8785en/I8785EN.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/\">http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/\">http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/en/\">http://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/en/</a> </p>","target_number":"5.a","goal_number":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-0a-02"};
