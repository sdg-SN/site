The former limits the frame of reference to economic activity, while the latter extends it to include both economic activity <em>and</em> unpaid household services, that is, the production of domestic and personal services by a household member for consumption within their own household, commonly called &#x201C;household chores&#x201D;. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Following from this, two indicators are used for measuring child labour for the purpose of SDG reporting, the first based on the production boundary set by the UN SNA and the second based on the general production boundary.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Indicator 1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (<strong>SNA production boundary basis</strong>)</p>\n<p><em>Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range</em>: children working for 1 hour or more per week in economic activity; </p>\n<p><em>Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range</em>: children working for 14 hours or more per week in economic activity;</p>\n<p><em>Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range</em>: children working for 43 hours or more per week in economic activity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Indicator 2: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities and household chores at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (<strong>general production boundary basis</strong>): </p>\n<p><em>Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range</em>: children working for 1 hour or more per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for 21 hours or more per week; </p>\n<p><em>Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range</em>: children working for 14 hours or more per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for 21 hours or more per week; </p>\n<p><em>Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range</em>: children working for 43 hours or more per week in economic activity.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The concept of child labour also includes the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous (18<sup>th</sup> ICLS paragraphs 33 to 34) as well as hazardous work (18<sup>th</sup> ICLS paragraphs 21 to 32). The worst forms of child labour include all forms of slavery or similar practices such as trafficking and the recruitment and use of child soldiers, the use or procurement of children for prostitution or other illicit activities, and other work that is likely to harm children&#x2019;s health, safety or well-being. </p>\n<p> </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> 20th International Conference of Labour Statisticians.

Estimates of child labour generated by these survey instruments are increasingly relied on by countries to monitor progress towards national and global child labour elimination targets. Many countries also produce national labour estimates and reports that often include data on child labour and/or employment among children. </p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING). </p>\n<p>As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to, to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices (NSOs), as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. The results of this country consultation are reviewed and discussed with ILO. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. </p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>UNICEF will undertake an annual country consultation likely between December and January every year to allow for review and processing of the feedback received in order to meet global SDG reporting deadlines. </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Updated data on 8.7.1 will be available in the SDG reporting period every February/March.</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National Statistical Offices (for the most part) and line ministries/other government agencies and International agencies that have conducted labour force surveys or other household surveys through which data on child labour were collected. </p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF) and International Labour Organization (ILO) </p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO is the UN focal point for labour statistics. It sets international standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. It also compiles and produces labour statistics with the goal of disseminating internationally comparable datasets, and provides technical assistance and training to ILO member States to support their efforts to produce high quality labour market data, including child labour data.</p>\n<p>UNICEF provides technical and financial assistance to Member States to support their efforts to collect high quality data on child labour, including through UNICEF-supported MICS household survey programme. UNICEF also compiles child labour statistics with the goal of making internationally comparable datasets publicly available, and it analyzes child labour statistics, which are included in relevant data-driven publications, including in its flagship publication, <em>The State of the World&#x2019;s Children</em>. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Far too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future and our collective futures. According to the latest ILO global estimates, about 152 million children worldwide &#x2013; 64 million girls and 88 million boys - are child labourers, accounting for almost 10 percent of the child population. These stark figures underscore the need for accelerated progress against child labour in the lead up to the 2025 target date for ending child labour in all its forms, and the accompanying need for child labour statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this regard. Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on the nature and extent of child labour provide a basis for determining priorities for national global action against child labour. Statistical information on child labour, and more broadly on all working children, also provide a basis for increasing public awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks and policies. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>While the concept of child labour includes working in activities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of estimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond age-specific hourly thresholds are used as a proxy for hazardous work for the purpose of reporting on SDG indicator 8.7.1. Further methodological work is needed to validate questions specifically aimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Similarly, while the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous also form part of the concept of child labour more broadly, data on the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in regular household surveys given difficulties with accurately and reliably measuring it. Therefore, this element of child labour is not captured by the indicators used for reporting on SDG 8.7.1. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition, &#x2018;own use production of goods&#x2019;, including activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, falls within the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). However, for the purpose of SDG reporting of indicator 8.7.1, and with the goal of facilitating international comparability, fetching water and collecting firewood have been classified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores), a form of production that lies outside the SNA production boundary. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More broadly, child labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful benchmarks for international comparative purposes but are <u>not</u> necessarily consistent with estimates based on national child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; organizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup> This means that there is no single legal definition of child labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national legislation across countries. </p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-4\">3</sup><p> Principal areas of flexibility in the Convention include: (a)<em>minimum ages</em>: Members whose economy and educational facilities are insufficiently developed may specify a lower general minimum age of 14 years (Art. 2.4) and a lower age range for light work of 12 to 14 years (Art 7.4); and (b) <em>scope of application</em>: Members may exclude from the application of the Convention limited (non-hazardous) categories of employment or work in respect of which special and substantial problems of application arise (Art. 4.1).
