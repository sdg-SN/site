Approximately 40% of the world&#x2019;s population lives in river and lake basins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development of water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on countries sharing transboundary basins, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, which are often interlinked. Intensive water use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising the development aspirations of countries sharing transboundary basins and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is in many cases not advanced. </p>\n<p>Specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between countries sharing transboundary basins are a key precondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as reflected in the 1992 Water Convention, the 1997 Watercourses Convention, and the 2008 draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers), as well as existing experience and good practices, all point to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured by the four criteria for operationality.</p>\n<p>This is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and the importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the advancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).</p>\n<p>Progress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of indicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing activities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover all surface waters and groundwaters.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The spatial information on transboundary surface water basins&#x2019; boundaries and the extent of the catchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no updating need is expected.</p>\n<p>The information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information is generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical studies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification of additional transboundary aquifers.</p>\n<p>In situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with all its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such complementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from the reporting at the national level. </p>\n<p>The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters is commonly a long process that takes many years. </p>\n<p>The operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could potentially be observed.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifers in the territory of the country</p>\n<p>While the identification of transboundary surface water is relatively straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers often requires more considered investigations.</p>\n<p>If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable.</p>\n<p>Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sum</p>\n<p>Commonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. </p>\n<p>The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of systems (e.g. river and lakes basin and aquifers) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river or lake basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on transboundary aquifers. </p>\n<p>The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface river and lake basins and the aquifers can be used to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement exists on either one).</p>\n<p>Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary water cooperation and verify which transboundary waters are covered</p>\n<p>Some operational arrangements for transboundary water cooperation in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters (and their associated river and lakes basins and aquifers). In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate the indicator value. In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the river basin or sub-basin and in such cases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for calculating the indicator value. At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by arrangements for transboundary water cooperation (and their respective areas). </p>\n<p>Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary water cooperation are operational</p>\n<p>The following check-list allows countries to determine whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular country is operational:</p>\n<p>- does a joint body or mechanism for transboundary water cooperation exist? </p>\n<p>- is there at least annual (on average) formal communication in form of meetings, either at the political and/or technical level?</p>\n<p>- has a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives been adopted? </p>\n<p>- is there at least annual (on average) exchange of information and data?</p>\n<p>If any of the conditions are not met, the arrangement for transboundary water cooperation cannot be considered operational. This information is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin databases.</p>\n<p>Step 5 Calculate the indicator value</p>\n<p>Calculate the indicator value, by adding up the total surface area in the country of the transboundary surface waters and aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers).

Basin level data can also be disaggregated to country level (for national reporting) and aggregated to regional and global level.</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>As the computation of the indicator is based on the spatial information (&#x201C;transboundary basin area&#x201D;) and operationality of arrangements as the two basic components, differences can arise in the computation of each of these components individually.</p>\n<p>Regarding both components, countries have the most up-to-date information, which can be supplemented by the data from various international projects and inventories, which contribute also to establishing a baseline globally.</p>\n<p>The difference on the value of transboundary basin area can arise from a different delineation of the transboundary water bodies, especially aquifers, or even the consideration of their transboundary nature as their identification and delineation can be based on different hydrogeological studies and can be updated, which is not necessarily reflected in international databases.</p>\n<p>The difference in the consideration of the operationality of the arrangements may arise from not identifying the same arrangements or considering differently the four criteria that serve as the basis for the operationality classification: </p>\n<p>- existence of a joint body or mechanism for transboundary cooperation </p>\n<p>- regularity of formal communication in form of meetings </p>\n<p>- existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives </p>\n<p>- regularity of the exchange of information and data </p>\n<p>A different interpretation in the object of application (only surface water or both surface water and groundwater) may constitute another reason.</p>\n<p>Collection of country input through validation mechanisms, has improved and will continue to improve, the consistency and accuracy of the information across the countries as the monitoring progresses.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p>UNECE: <a href=\"https://unece.org/environmental-policy/water/transboundary_water_cooperation_reporting\">https://unece.org/environmental-policy/water/transboundary_water_cooperation_reporting</a></p>\n<p>UNESCO: https://www.unesco.org/en/ihp/sdg6-5-2 ;</p>\n<p>UN-WATER SDG6 monitoring: <a href=\"http://www.sdg6monitoring.org/indicator-652\">www.sdg6monitoring.org/indicator-652</a> </p>\n<p>UN-WATER SDG6 data portal: <a href=\"http://www.sdg6data.org/indicator/6.5.2\">www.sdg6data.org/indicator/6.5.2</a></p>\n<p>Decision VII/2 establishing the reporting mechanism under the Water Convention: <a href=\"https://unece.org/DAM/env/documents/2015/WAT/11Nov_17-19_MOP7_Budapest/ece.mp.wat.49.add.2.eng.pdf\">https://unece.org/DAM/env/documents/2015/WAT/11Nov_17-19_MOP7_Budapest/ece.mp.wat.49.add.2.eng.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Additional documentation:</strong></p>\n<p>Global Environment Facility&#x2019;s Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme: <a href=\"http://www.geftwap.org/\">http://www.geftwap.org/</a> </p>\n<p>Internationally Shared Aquifer Resources Management Programme (UNESCO&#x2019;s International Hydrological Programme): <a href=\"http://www.isarm.org/\">http://www.isarm.org/</a> </p>\n<p>Treaties on transboundary waters, Oregon State University: <a href=\"https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-freshwater-treaties-database\">https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-freshwater-treaties-database</a></p>\n<p>International River Basin Organisations database, Oregon State University: <a href=\"https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-river-basin-organization-rbo-database\">https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-river-basin-organization-rbo-database</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Regional examples: </em></strong></p>\n<p>Assessment of transboundary water cooperation in the pan-European region: <a href=\"https://unece.org/environment-policy/publications/second-assessment-transboundary-rivers-lakes-and-groundwaters\">https://unece.org/environment-policy/publications/second-assessment-transboundary-rivers-lakes-and-groundwaters</a></p>\n<p>Inventory of Shared Water Resources in Western Asia: <a href=\"https://www.unescwa.org/publications/inventory-shared-water-resources-western-asia\">https://www.unescwa.org/publications/inventory-shared-water-resources-western-asia</a> </p>","target_number":"6.5","goal_number":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-05-02"};
