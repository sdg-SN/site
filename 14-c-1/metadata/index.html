It is a framework instrument, which provides for the development of other instruments that conform toits provisions. Therefore, progress in the implementation of international law as reflected in UNCLOS can only be comprehensively measured if progress in the implementation of ocean-related instruments that implement international law as reflected in UNCLOS, is also measured. </p>\n<p>Such instruments include, in particular, UNCLOS&#x2019;s two implementing agreements - the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Part XI Agreement) and the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA). </p>\n<p>Accordingly, following extensive consultation with Member States and other stakeholders, the methodology for indicator 14.c.1 measures the number of countries making progress in ratifying, acceding to and implementing UNCLOS, the Part XI Agreement and UNFSA through legal, policy and institutional frameworks. </p>\n<p>Data collected through the first administration of the questionnaire, which is based on the indicator, will provide a baseline of the current state of ratification of, accession to and implementation of UNCLOS and its two implementing agreements. Subsequent indicator-based data will then show progress made by countries.</p>\n<p>Countries that do not respond to the questionnaire, or do not approve the use of their responses to the questionnaire, will not receive indicator scores.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Implementation of UNCLOS and its implementing agreements through legal frameworks (for example, through national legislation or executive acts) as well as policy and institutional frameworks will be scored on the basis of a self-analysis by countries of the extent of implementation.

They are coded with simple &#x201C;Yes/No&#x201D; answers, with a score of &#x201C;1&#x201D; for &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; and &#x201C;0&#x201D; for &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Each country&#x2019;s overall score for ratification of or accession to these instruments will therefore be a number between 0 and 3, which will be reported as a percentage (with &#x201C;100&#x201D; representing a score of &#x201C;3&#x201D;, and &#x201C;0&#x201D; representing a score of &#x201C;0&#x201D;).</p>\n<p>Countries will also be invited to respond to questions which relate to implementation of UNCLOS and its two implementing agreements through legal frameworks (Questions 1.2, 2.2 and 3.2) by evaluating their own national implementation and assigning a score of between 1 and 9 &#x2013; with &#x201C;1&#x201D; being &#x201C;not at all&#x201D; and &#x201C;9&#x201D; being &#x201C;fully&#x201D; &#x2013; or indicating that the question of implementation is not applicable (&#x201C;N/A&#x201D;). </p>\n<p>Countries will further be invited to indicate whether they have a national policy and/or a national institution or another mechanism, such as a national focal point or an inter-agency or inter-departmental working group, with responsibility for ensuring that the problems of ocean space, matters related to the Part XI Agreement and matters related to UNFSA are considered through an integrated, interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral approach (Questions 1.3, 2.3 and 3.3). These questions are coded with simple &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, &#x201C;No&#x201D; and &#x201C;N/A&#x201D; answers, with a score of &#x201C;1&#x201D; for &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; and &#x201C;0&#x201D; for &#x201C;No&#x201D;. </p>\n<p>The scoring methodology regarding implementation is the total of the scores reported by States regarding implementation through legal frameworks for UNCLOS and each of its two implementing agreements (in response to Questions 1.2, 2.2 and 3.2), added to the relevant scores achieved regarding implementation through national policy and/or national institutions for UNCLOS and each of its implementing agreements (in respect to Questions 1.3, 2.3 and 3.3). Pursuant to this scoring methodology, each State could achieve a maximum score of 30 points for implementation.
