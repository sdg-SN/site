It includes: laws, regulations, standards, by-laws, codes, etc. They can relate to different types of jurisdictions such as a ministry, state, municipality, or group of states. </li>\n  <li><strong>Non-binding</strong>: a non-binding policy instrument refers to a coherent set of decisions associated to a common vision, objective and/or direction, and to a proposed course of action to achieve these. It includes, for instance: action plans, policies, strategies, programmes, and projects. They can have different scopes of application (international, national, local, etc.).</li>\n  <li>At another level, different categories of policy instruments can be distinguished: <ul>\n      <li>Macro policies (e.g. national strategies/action plans, new institutions/entities)</li>\n      <li>Regulatory and legal instruments (e.g. laws, standards, enforcement measures)</li>\n      <li>Economic and fiscal instruments (taxes and tax incentives, grants, preferential loans, etc.) </li>\n      <li>Voluntary and self-regulation schemes (e.g. sectoral partnerships, codes of conduct, CSR initiatives)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that, except for regulatory / legal instruments and voluntary / self-regulation schemes, the options above are not mutually exclusive: for instance, an economic instrument can be legally binding. </p>\n<p><strong>&#x201C;Policy cycle&#x201D;:</strong> this political science concept is widely used to analyse and inform public policy-making processes, but can be transposed to any recurrent pattern leading to the implementation of a policy or policy instrument. The following approach with regards to the various stages of the policy cycle is adopted: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Policy development, including Agenda setting (e.g. the problem identified is high enough on the public agenda that action becomes likely) and Policy design (e.g. setting objectives, identifying costs-benefits of potential policy instruments and selecting); </li>\n  <li>Policy adopted or officially launched (e.g. adopting or authorizing the preferred policy options through the legislative process and refined through the bureaucratic process); </li>\n  <li>Policy under implementation through specific actions (e.g. translating policy into concrete action and policy instruments); results and impacts are being monitored;</li>\n  <li>Policy and related action plan has reached its end date and has been evaluated.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> <em>UNEP (2010).

The purpose of this indicator is to help assess the volume and geographical repartition of governments progressing on sustainable consumption and production. In addition, further information is being collected on the types, focus and orientation of the policy instruments that are being developed and used, to monitor their progression over time as well as their contribution to other Sustainable Development Goals. This should support evaluation of how much / how fast governments progress in the development and application of policies addressing sustainable consumption and production, whether at cross-cutting or sectoral level.</p>\n<p>The indicator is also considering both binding (laws and regulations) and non-binding policy instruments. The first category is essential to the shift, as binding instruments provide the legal ground for sustainable consumption and production, and can be used for enforcement or to provide incentives. The ability to develop, pass and implement legislation is an indication of jurisdictions&#x2019; engagement in the shift towards sustainable consumption and production. This indicator can also help monitor the evolution of the global legislative landscape. The second category is also essential to ensure institutional engagement, commitment and ownership. In some cases, non-binding policy instruments can lead to the creation of new legal ones. The development and implementation of non-binding instruments across sectors also provides information on engagement of partners and other stakeholders in sustainable consumption and production.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>the indicator quantifies and monitors countries&#x2019; progress along the policy cycle of binding and non-binding policy instruments aimed at supporting Sustainable Consumption and Production. It does not provide any qualitative information and whether policies were well-designed or if a proper background analysis had been conducted, the quality of implementation, level of enforcement, and its effects. These aspects will have to be looked at through narrative reports / qualitative analysis. </p>\n<p>The indicator encompasses policy instruments supporting the shift to SCP, including: policies which identify SCP as a key priority, policies focused on SCP and sectoral policies with SCP objectives. It is acknowledged that sectoral policies are also being reported under other SDG indicators and in particular 12.7.1 (# of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans).</p>\n<p>Establishing baselines and targets can be time and resource intensive and depends on the willingness of 10YFP National Focal Points to communicate necessary information. </p>\n<p>Main aspects regarding precision, reliability, attribution and double counting are addressed above.
